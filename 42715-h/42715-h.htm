<h2>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION</h2>

<p>For twenty-five years Professor Mau has devoted himself to
the study of Pompeii, spending his summers among the ruins
and his winters in Rome, working up the new material. He
holds a unique place among the scholars who have given attention
to Pompeian antiquities, and his contributions to the literature
of the subject have been numerous in both German and
Italian. The present volume, however, is not a translation of
one previously issued, but a new work first published in English,
the liberality of the publishers having made it possible to secure
assistance for the preparation of certain restorations and other
drawings which Professor Mau desired to have made as illustrating
his interpretation of the ruins.</p>

<p>In one respect there is an essential difference between the
remains of Pompeii and those of the large and famous cities
of antiquity, as Rome or Athens, which have associated with
them the familiar names of historical characters. Mars' Hill is
clothed with human interest, if for no other reason, because of
its relation to the work of the Apostle Paul; while the Roman
Forum and the Palatine, barren as they seem to-day, teem with
life as there rise before the mind's eye the scenes presented in
the pages of classical writers. But the Campanian city played
an unimportant part in contemporary history; the name of not
a single great Pompeian is recorded. The ruins, deprived of
the interest arising from historical associations, must be interpreted
with little help from literary sources, and repeopled with
aggregate rather than individual life.</p>

<p>A few Pompeians, whose features have survived in herms or
statues and whose names are known from the inscriptions, seem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VI" id="Page_VI">vi</a></span>
near to us,&mdash;such are Caecilius Jucundus and the generous
priestess Eumachia; but the characters most commonly associated
with the city are those of fiction. Here, in a greater
degree than in most places, the work of reconstruction involves
the handling of countless bits of evidence, which, when viewed
by themselves, often seem too minute to be of importance; the
blending of these into a complete and faithful picture is a task
of infinite painstaking, the difficulty of which will best be appreciated
by one who has worked in this field.</p>

<p>It was at first proposed to place at the end of the book a
series of bibliographical notes on the different chapters, giving
references to the more important treatises and articles dealing
with the matters presented. But on fuller consideration it
seemed unnecessary thus to add to the bulk of the volume;
those who are interested in the study of a particular building
or aspect of Pompeian culture will naturally turn to the <i>Pompeianarum
antiquitatum historia</i>, the reports in the <i>Notizie degli
Scavi</i>, the reports and articles by Professor Mau in the Roman
<i>Mittheilungen</i> of the German Archaeological Institute, the
Overbeck-Mau <i>Pompeji</i>, the Studies by Mau and by Nissen,
the commemorative volume issued in 1879 under the title
<i>Pompei e la regione sotterrata dal Vesuvio</i>, the catalogues of
the paintings by Helbig and Sogliano, together with Mau's
<i>Geschichte der decorativen Wandmalerei in Pompeji</i>, H. von
Rohden's <i>Terracotten von Pompeji</i>, and the older illustrated
works, as well as the beautiful volume, <i>Pompeji vor der Zerstoerung</i>,
published in 1897 by Weichardt.</p>

<p>The titles of more than five hundred books and pamphlets
relating to Pompeii are given in Furchheim's <i>Bibliografia di
Pompei</i> (second edition, Naples, 1891). To this list should be
added an elaborate work on the temple of Isis, <i>Aedis Isidis
Pompeiana</i>, which is soon to appear. The copperplates for
the engravings were prepared at the expense of the old Accademia
ercolanese, but only the first section of the work was
published; the plates, fortunately, have been preserved without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VII" id="Page_VII">vii</a></span>
injury, and the publication has at last been undertaken by
Professor Sogliano.</p>

<p>Professor Mau wishes to make grateful acknowledgment of
obligation to Messrs. C. Bazzani, R. Koldewey, G. Randanini,
and G. Tognetti for kind assistance in making ready for the
engraver the drawings presenting restorations of buildings; to
the authorities of the German Archaeological Institute for
freely granting the use of a number of drawings in its collection;
and to the photographer, Giacomo Brogi of Florence, for
placing his collection of photographs at the author's disposal
and making special prints for the use of the engraver. In
addition to the photographs obtained from Brogi, a small number
were furnished for the volume by the translator, and a few
were derived from other sources.</p>

<p>The restorations are not fanciful. They were made with
the help of careful measurements and of computations based
upon the existing remains; occasionally also evidence derived
from reliefs and wall paintings was utilized. Uncertain details
are generally omitted.</p>

<p>It is due to Professor Mau to say that in preparing his manuscript
for English readers I have, with his permission, made
some changes. The order of presentation has occasionally been
altered. In several chapters the German manuscript has been
abridged, while in others, containing points in regard to which
English readers might desire a somewhat fuller statement, I
have made slight additions. The preparation of the English
form of the volume, undertaken for reasons of friendship, has
been less a task than a pleasure.</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION</h2>

<p>The author and the translator unite in expressing their deep
appreciation of the kind reception accorded to the first edition
of this book.</p>

<p>The second edition has been revised on the spot. Besides
minor additions, it has been enlarged by a chapter on the recently
discovered temple of Venus Pompeiana, and a Bibliographical
Appendix; prepared in response to requests from various quarters.
Among the new illustrations in the text are a restoration
of the temple of Vespasian and a reproduction of the bronze
youth found in 1900, besides the Alexandria patera and one of
the skeleton cups from the Boscoreale treasure; in <a href="#plate08">Plate VIII</a>
are presented two additional paintings from the house of the
Vettii.</p>

<p>The translator is alone responsible for <a href="#chap_lix">Chapter LIX</a>, which
was prepared for the first edition at Professor Mau's request, at
a time when he was pressed with other work; for the paragraphs
in regard to the treasure of Boscoreale, and for one-half of the
references in the Bibliographical Appendix.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3 class="chap1">CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE SITUATION OF POMPEII</i></span></h3>

<p>From Gaeta, where the south end of the Volscian range
borders abruptly upon the sea, to the peninsula of Sorrento, a
broad gulf stretched in remote ages, cutting its way far into the
land. Its waves dashed upon the base of the mountains which
now, rising with steep slope, mark the eastern boundary of the
Campanian Plain&mdash;Mt. Tifata above Capua, Mt. Taburno back
of Nola, and lying across the southeast corner, the huge mass
of Monte Sant' Angelo, whose sharply defined line of elevation
is continued in the heights of Sorrento.</p>

<p>This gulf was transformed by volcanic agencies into a fertile
plain. Here two fissures in the earth's crust cross each other,
each marked by a series of extinct or active volcanoes. One
fissure runs in the direction of the Italian Peninsula; along
it lie Monti Berici near Vicenza, Mt. Amiata below Chiusi, the
lakes of Bolsena and Bracciano filling extinct craters, the Alban
Mountains, and finally Stromboli and Aetna. The other runs
from east to west; its direction is indicated by Mt. Vulture
near Venosa, Mt. Epomeo on the island of Ischia, and the
Ponza Islands.</p>

<p>At three places in the old sea basin the subterranean fires
burst forth. Near the north shore rose the great volcano of
Rocca Monfina, which added itself to the Volscian Mountains,
and heaping the products of its eruptions upon Mons Massicus,&mdash;once
an island,&mdash;formed with this the northern boundary of
the plain. Toward the middle the numerous small vents of the
Phlegraean Fields threw up the low heights, to which the north
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
shore of the Bay of Naples&mdash;Posilipo, Baiae, Misenum&mdash;is
indebted for its incomparable beauty of landscape. Finally,
near the south shore, at the intersection of the fissures, the
massive cone of Vesuvius rose, in complete isolation&mdash;the
only volcano on the continent of Europe still remaining active.
Its base on the southwest is washed by the sea, while on the
other sides a stretch of level country separates it from the
mountains that hem in the plain. On the side opposite from
the sea, however, Vesuvius comes so near to the mountains
that we may well say that it divides the Campanian plain into
two parts, of which the larger, on the northwest side, is drained
by the Volturno; the small southeast section is the plain of the
Sarno.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 1.&mdash;Map of Ancient Campania.<br />
<a href="images/fig001fs.jpg">View larger image</a></p>
</div>

<p>The Sarno, like the Umbrian Clitumnus, has no upper course.
At the foot of Mt. Taburno, bounding the plain on the northeast,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
are five copious springs that soon unite to form a stream.
Since 1843 the river has been drawn off for purposes of irrigation
into three channels, which are graded at different levels;
the distribution of water thus assured makes this part of Campania
one of the most fertile districts in Italy. In antiquity the
Sarno must have been confined to a single channel; according
to Strabo it was navigable for ships.</p>

<p>In Roman times three cities shared in the possession of the
Sarno plain. Furthest inland, facing the pass in the mountains
that opens toward the Gulf of Salerno, lay Nuceria, now Nocera.
On the seashore, where the coast road to Sorrento branches off
toward the southwest, was Stabiae, now Castellammare. North
of Stabiae, at the foot of Vesuvius, Pompeii stood, on an elevation
overlooking the Sarno, formed by the end of a stream of
lava that in some past age had flowed from Vesuvius down
toward the sea. Pompeii thus united the advantages of an
easily fortified hill town with those of a maritime city. "It
lies," says Strabo, "on the Sarnus, which accommodates a
traffic in both imports and exports; it is the seaport of Nola,
Nuceria, and Acerrae."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig002" id="fig002"></a>
<img src="images/fig002.jpg" width="550" height="268" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 2.&mdash;Vesuvius as seen from Naples.</p>
</div>

<p>A glance at the map will show how conveniently situated
Pompeii was to serve as a seaport for Nola and Nuceria;
but it seems hardly credible that the inhabitants of Acerrae,
which lay much nearer Naples, should have preferred for their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
marine traffic the circuitous route around Vesuvius to the Sarno.
However that may have been, Pompeii was beyond doubt the
most important town in the Sarno plain.</p>

<p>Pompeii formerly lay nearer the sea and nearer the river
than at present. In the course of the centuries alluvial deposits
have pushed the shore line further and further away. It is
now about a mile and a quarter from the nearest point of the
city to the sea; in antiquity it was less than a third of a mile.
The line of the ancient coast can still be traced by means of a
clearly marked depression, beyond which the stratification of
the volcanic deposits thrown out in 79 does not reach. The
Sarno, too, now flows nearly two thirds of a mile from Pompeii;
in antiquity, according to all indications, it was not more than
half so far away.</p>

<p>In point of climate and outlook, a fairer site for a city could
scarcely have been chosen. The Pompeian, living in clear air,
could look down upon the fogs which in the wet season frequently
rose from the river and spread over the plain. And
while in winter Stabiae, lying on the northwest side of Monte
Sant' Angelo, enjoyed the sun for only a few hours, the elevation
on which Pompeii stood, sloping gently toward the east and
south, more sharply toward the west, was bathed in sunlight
during the entire day.</p>

<p>Winter at Pompeii is mild and short; spring and autumn
are long. The heat of summer, moreover, is not extreme. In
the early morning, it is true, the heat is at times oppressive.
No breath of air stirs; and we look longingly off upon the
expanse of sea where, far away on the horizon, in the direction
of Capri, a dark line of rippling waves becomes visible.
Nearer it comes, and nearer. About ten o'clock it reaches
the shore. The leaves begin to rustle, and in a few moments
the sea breeze sweeps over the city, strong, cool, and invigorating.
The wind blows till just before sunset. The early
hours of the evening are still; the pavements and the walls
of the houses give out the heat which they have absorbed
during the day. But soon&mdash;perhaps by nine o'clock&mdash;the
tree tops again begin to murmur, and all night long, from the
mountains of the interior, a gentle, refreshing stream of air
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
flows down through the gardens, the roomy atriums and
colonnades of the houses, the silent streets, and the buildings
about the Forum, with an effect indescribably soothing.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig003" id="fig003"></a>
<img src="images/fig003.jpg" width="550" height="435" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 3.&mdash;View from Pompeii, looking south.</p>
</div>

<p>How shall I undertake to convey to the reader who has
not visited Pompeii, an impression of the beauty of its situation?
Words are weak when confronted with the reality. Sea,
mountains, and plain,&mdash;strong and pleasing background,&mdash;great
masses and brilliant yet harmonious colors, splendid foreground
effects and hazy vistas, undisturbed nature and the handiwork
of man, all are blended into a landscape of the grand style,
the like of which I should not know where else to look for.</p>

<p>If we turn toward the south, we have at our feet the level
plain of the Sarno, in antiquity as now&mdash;we may suppose&mdash;not
checkered with villages but dotted here and there with groups
of farm buildings, surrounded with stately trees. Beyond the
plain rises the lofty barrier of Monte Sant' Angelo, thickly wooded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
in places, its summit standing out against the sky in a long,
beautiful profile, which, toward the right, breaks up into bold,
rugged notches; the side of the mountain below is richly diversified
with deep valleys, projecting ridges, and terraces that
in the distance seem like steps, where among vineyards and
olive orchards stand two villages fair to look on, Gragnano
and Lettere, so near that individual houses can be clearly
distinguished. Further west the plain before us opens out
upon the sea, while the mountains are continued in the precipitous
coast of the peninsula of Sorrento. Height crowds
upon height, with villages wreathed in olive orchards lying
between. Here the hills descend in terraces to the sea, covered
with vegetation to the water's edge; there the covering of soil
has been cast off from the steep slopes, exposing the naked
rock, which shines in the afternoon sun with a reddish hue that
wonderfully accords with the dark shades of the foliage and the
brilliant blue of the sea. Further on the tints become duller,
and the sight is blurred; only with effort can we distinguish Sorrento,
resting on cliffs that rise almost perpendicularly from the
line of the shore. Further still the outline of the peninsula
sinks into the sea and gives place to Capri, island of fantastic
shape, whose crags rising sheer from the water stand out
sharply in the bright sunlight.</p>

<p>But we look toward the north, and the splendid variety of
form and color vanishes; there stands only the vast, sombre
mass of the great destroyer, Vesuvius, towering above the city
and the plain. The sun as it nears the horizon veils the bare
ashen cone with a mantle of deep violet, while the cloud of
smoke that rises from the summit shines with a golden glow.
Far above the base the sides are covered with vineyards, among
which small groups of white houses can here and there be seen.
West of us the outline of the mountain descends in a strong,
simple curve to the sea. Just before it blends with the
shore there rise behind it distant heights wrapped in blue
haze, the first of moderate elevation, then others more prominent
and further to the left. They are the heights along the
north shore of the Bay of Naples&mdash;Gaurus crowned with
the monastery of Camaldoli, famous for its magnificent view;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
the cliffs of Baiae, the promontory of Misenum, and the lofty
cone of Epomeo on the island of Ischia. So the eye traverses
the whole expanse of the Bay; Naples itself, hidden
from our view, lies between those distant heights and the base
of Vesuvius.</p>

<p>But meanwhile the sun has set behind Misenum; its last rays
are lighting up the cloud of smoke above Vesuvius and the
summit of Monte Sant' Angelo. The brilliancy of coloring has
faded; the weary eye finds rest in the soft afterglow. We also
may take leave of these beautiful surroundings, and inquire into
the beginnings of the city which was founded here.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="s08"><i>BEFORE 79</i></span></h3>

<p>When Pompeii was founded we do not know. It is more
than likely that a site so well adapted for a city was occupied
at an early date. The oldest building, the Doric temple in the
Forum Triangulare, is of the style of the sixth century <span class="s08">B.C.</span>;
we are safe in assuming that the city was then already in existence.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
The founders were Oscans. They belonged to a widely
scattered branch of the Italic stock, whose language, closely related
with the Latin, has been imperfectly recovered from a considerable
number of inscriptions, so imperfectly that in each of
the longer inscriptions there still remain words the meaning
of which is obscure or doubtful. From this language the name
of the city came; for <i>pompe</i> in Oscan meant 'five.' The word
does not, however, appear in its simple form; we have only the
adjective derived from it, <i>pompaiians</i>, 'Pompeian.' If we are
right in assuming that the name appeared in Oscan, as it does
in Latin, in the plural form, it was probably applied first to a
gens, or clan, and thence to the city; the Latin equivalent of
Pompeii would be Quintii. Pompeii was thus the city of the
clan of the Pompeys, as Tarquinii was the city of the Tarquins,
and Veii the city of the Veian clan. The name Pompeius was
common in Pompeii down to the destruction of the city, and in
other Campanian towns, notably Puteoli, to much later times.</p>

<p>In order to follow the course of events at Pompeii, it will be
necessary to pass briefly in review the main points in the history
of Campania. The Campanian Oscans, sprung from a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
rude and hardy race, became civilized from contact with the
Greeks, who at an early period had settled in Cumae, in Dicaearchia,
afterward Puteoli, and in Parthenope, later Naples; and
the coast climate had an enervating effect upon them. When
toward the end of the fifth century <span class="s08">B.C.</span> the Samnites, kinsmen
of the Oscans, left their rugged mountain homes in the interior
and pressed down toward the coast, the Oscans were unable to
cope with them. In 424 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> the Samnites stormed and took
Capua, in 420, Cumae; and Pompeii likewise fell into their
hands. But they were no more successful than the Oscans had
been in resisting the influence of Greek culture. How strong
this influence was may be seen in the remains at Pompeii. The
architecture of the period was Greek; Greek divinities were
honored, as Apollo and Zeus Milichius; and the standard measures
of the <i>mensa ponderaria</i> were inscribed with Greek names.</p>

<p>In less than a hundred years new strifes arose between the
more cultured Samnites of the plain and their rough and warlike
kinsmen in the mountains. But Rome took a part in the
struggle, and in the Samnite Wars (343-290 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>) brought both
the men of the mountains and the men of the plain under her
dominion. Although the sovereignty of Rome took the form
of a perpetual alliance, the cities in reality lost their independence.
The complete subjugation and Romanizing of Campania,
however, did not come till the time of the Social War
(90-88 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>) and the supremacy of Sulla; the Samnites staked
all on the success of the popular party, and lost.</p>

<p>In the narrative of these events Pompeii is not often mentioned.
At the time of the Second Samnite War, in the year 310
<span class="s08">B.C.</span>, we read that a Roman fleet under Publius Cornelius landed
at the mouth of the Sarno, and that a pillaging expedition followed
the course of the river as far as Nuceria; but the country
folk fell on the marauders as they were returning, and forced
them to give up their booty. We have no definite information
regarding the attitude of the Pompeians after the battle of
Cannae (216 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>); probably they joined the side of Hannibal,
who, however, was defeated by Marcus Marcellus near Nola in
the following year, and was obliged to leave Campania to the
Romans.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>In the Social War, when, in the summer of 90 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, the Samnite
army marched into Campania, Pompeii allied itself with
the insurgents; as a consequence, in 89, it was besieged by
Sulla, but without success. Two years later, Sulla went to Asia
to conduct the war against Mithridates. Returning victorious
in the spring of 83 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, he led his army into Campania, where
he spent the winter of 83-82; his soldiers, grown brutal in the
Asiatic war and accustomed to every kind of license, may have
proved unwelcome guests for the Pompeians.</p>

<p>The sequel came in the year 80, when a colony of Roman
veterans was settled in Pompeii under the leadership of Publius
Sulla, a nephew of the Dictator. Cicero later made a speech
in behalf of this Sulla, defending him against the charge that
he had taken part in the conspiracy of Catiline and had tried to
induce the old residents of Pompeii to join in the plot. From
this speech we learn that Sulla's reorganization of the city was
accomplished with so great regard for the interests of the
Pompeians, that they ever after held him in grateful remembrance.
We learn, also, that soon after the founding of the
colony disputes arose between the old residents and the colonists,
about the public walks (<i>ambulationes</i>) and matters connected
with the voting; the arrangements for voting had probably
been so made as to throw the decision always into the hands
of the colonists. The controversy was referred to the patrons
of the colony, and settled by them. From this time on, the life
of Pompeii seems not to have differed from that of the other
small cities of Italy.</p>

<p>As the harbor of Pompeii was on the Sarno, which flowed at
some distance from the city, there must have been a small
settlement at the landing place. To this probably belonged a
group of buildings, partly excavated in 1880-81, lying just across
the Sarno canal (canale del Bottaro), about a third of a mile
from the Stabian Gate. Here were found many skeletons, and
with them a quantity of gold jewellery, which was afterward
placed in the Museum at Naples. The most reasonable
explanation of the discovery is, that the harbor was here, and
that these persons, gathering up their valuables, fled from
Pompeii at the time of the eruption either in order to escape by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
sea or to take refuge in Stabiae. Flight in either case was cut
off. If ships were in the harbor, they must soon have been
filled with the volcanic deposits; if there was a bridge across
the river it was probably thrown down by the earthquake.</p>

<p>A second suburb sprang up near the sea, in connection with
the salt works (<i>salinae</i>) of the city. Our knowledge of the
inhabitants, the Salinenses, is derived from several inscriptions
painted upon walls, in which they recommend candidates for the
municipal offices, and from an inscription scratched upon the
plaster of a column in which a fuller by the name of Crescens
sends them a greeting: <i>Cresce[n]s fullo Saline[n]sibus salute[m]</i>.
From another inscription we learn that they had an assembly,
<i>conventus</i>, possibly judicial in its functions; for in connection
with a date, it speaks of a fine of twenty sesterces, which would
amount to about 3½ shillings, or 85 cents: <i>VII K. dec. Salinis
in conventu multa HS XX</i>, 'Fine of twenty sesterces; assembly
at Salinae, November 25.' Still another inscription speaks
of attending such a meeting on November 19: <i>XIII K. dec.
in conventu veni</i>.</p>

<p>The suburb most frequently mentioned was at first called
Pagus Felix Suburbanus, but after the time of Augustus,
Pagus Augustus Felix Suburbanus. Its location is unknown.
As it evidently took the name of Felix from the Dictator Sulla,
who used this epithet as a surname, we may assume that its
origin dates from the establishment of the Roman colony; it
may have been founded to provide a place for those inhabitants
of Pompeii who had been forced to leave their homes in order
to make room for the colonists. The existence of a fourth
suburb is inferred from two painted inscriptions in which
candidates for office are recommended by the Campanienses;
this name would naturally be applied to the inhabitants of
a Pagus Campanus, who, perhaps, had originally come from
Capua.</p>

<p>Of the government of Pompeii in the earliest times, before
the Samnite conquest, nothing is known. The names of various
magistrates in the Samnite period, however, particularly the
period of alliance with Rome (290-90 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>), are learned from
inscriptions. Mention is made of a chief administrative officer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
(<i>mediss</i>, <i>mediss tovtiks</i>); of quaestors, who, probably, like the
quaestors in Rome, were charged with the financial administration
and let the contracts for public buildings; and of aediles,
to whom, no doubt, was intrusted the care of streets and buildings,
together with the policing of
the markets. The Latin names of
the last two officials suggest that
their offices were introduced after
290. There was also an assembly
called <i>kombenniom</i>, with which we
may compare the Latin <i>conventus</i>;
but whether it was an assembly of
the people or a city council cannot
now be determined.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 4.&mdash;Venus Pompeiana.<br />
From a wall painting.</p>
</div>

<p>After the establishment of the
Roman colony, Pompeii was named
<i>Colonia Cornelia Veneria Pompeianorum</i>,
from the gentile name of the
Dictator Sulla (Lucius Cornelius Sulla
Felix) and from the goddess to whom
he paid special honor, who now, as
Venus Pompeiana, became the tutelary
divinity of the city. This goddess
is represented in wall paintings. In that from which our
illustration is taken (<a href="#fig004">Fig. 4</a>), she appears in a blue mantle studded
with golden stars, and wears a crown set with green stones.
Her left hand, which holds a sceptre, rests upon a rudder; in
her right is a twig of olive. A Cupid stands upon a pedestal
beside her, holding up a mirror.</p>

<p>From this time the highest official body, as in Roman colonies
everywhere, was the city council, composed of decurions.
The administration was placed in the hands of two pairs of
officials, the duumvirs with judiciary authority, <i>duumviri iuri
dicundo</i>, and two aediles, who were responsible for the care
of buildings and streets and the oversight of the markets.
When the duumvirs and the aediles joined in official acts they
were known as the Board of Four, <i>quattuorviri</i>. Down to the
time of the Empire it appears that the aediles were not designated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
officially by that name, but by a title known to us only
in an abbreviated form, <i>duumviri v. a. sacr. p. proc.</i> This probably
stands for <i>duumviri viis, aedibus, sacris publicis procurandis</i>,
'duumvirs in charge of the streets, the temples, and the public
religious festivals.' The title of aedile seems to have been
avoided because it had been in use in the days of autonomy, and
the authorities thought it prudent to suppress everything that
would suggest the former state of independence. Nevertheless,
the word retained its place in ordinary speech, as is shown by its
use in the inscriptions painted on walls recommending candidates
for office; thence it finally forced its way back into the
official language. The duumvirs of every fifth year were called
quinquennial duumvirs, <i>duumviri quinquennales</i>, and assumed
functions corresponding with those of the censors at Rome;
they gave attention to matters of finance, and revised the lists
of decurions and of citizens.</p>

<p>All these officials were elected annually by popular vote.
The candidates offered themselves beforehand. If none came
forward, or there were too few,&mdash;for the city officials not only
received no salary, but were under obligation to make generous
contributions for public purposes, as theatrical representations,
games, and buildings,&mdash;the magistrate who presided at the
election named candidates for the vacancies; but each candidate
so named had the right to nominate a second for the same
vacancy, the second in turn a third. The voting was by ballot;
each voter threw his voting tablet into the urn of his precinct.
No information has come down to us regarding the precincts
(<i>curiae</i>) into which the city must have been divided for electoral
purposes.</p>

<p>The election of a candidate was valid only in case he received
the vote of an absolute majority of the precincts. If the result
was indecisive for all or a part of the offices, the city council
chose an extraordinary official who bore the title of prefect with
judiciary authority, <i>praefectus iuri dicundo</i>. This prefect took
the place of the duumvirs, not only when an election was indecisive,
but also when vacancies arose in some other way, or
when peculiar conditions seemed to make it desirable to have
an officer of unusual powers, a kind of dictator; or finally, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
the emperor had received the vote; in the last two cases, the
prefect was undoubtedly appointed by the emperor. Thus, in
the years 34 and 40 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>, the Emperor Caligula was duumvir of
Pompeii; but the duties of the office were discharged by a prefect.
A law passed in Rome toward the end of the Republic
on the motion of a certain Petronius contained provisions
regarding the appointment of prefects; one chosen in accordance
with them was called <i>praefectus ex lege Petronia</i>, 'prefect
according to the law of Petronius.'</p>

<p>There were also in Pompeii priests supported by the city, but
only a few of them are mentioned in the inscriptions. References
are found to augurs and pontifices, to a priest of Mars,
and to priests (<i>flamen</i>, <i>sacerdos</i>) of Augustus while he was still
living; Nero had a priest even before he ascended the throne.
Mention is made of priestesses, too, a priestess of Ceres and
Venus, priestesses of Ceres, and others, the divinities of whom
are not named.</p>

<p>The suburbs could scarcely have had a separate administration;
they remained within the jurisdiction of the magistrates
of the city. In the case of the Pagus Augustus Felix mention
is made of a <i>magister</i>, 'director,' <i>ministri</i>, 'attendants,' and
<i>pagani</i>, 'pagus officials'; but apparently these were all appointed
for religious functions only, in connection with the
worship of the emperor. The <i>magister</i> and the <i>pagani</i>, in
part at least, were freedmen; the four <i>ministri</i>, first appointed
in 7 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, were slaves.</p>

<p>Apart from commerce, an important source of income for the
Pompeians lay in the fertility of the soil. In antiquity, as now,
grapes were cultivated extensively on the ridge projecting from
the foot of Vesuvius toward the south. The evidence afforded
by the great number of wine jars, <i>amphorae</i> (<a href="#fig005">Fig. 5</a>), that have
been brought to light would warrant this conclusion; and lately
wine presses also have been discovered near Boscoreale, above
Pompeii. Pliny makes mention of the Pompeian wine, but
remarks that indulgence in it brings a headache that will last till
noon of the following day. The olive too was cultivated, but
only to a limited extent; this we infer from the small capacity
of the press and other appliances for making oil found in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
same villa in which the wine presses were discovered. At the
present time the making of oil is not carried on about Pompeii.
In the plain below the city vegetables were raised, as at the
present day; the cabbage and onions of Pompeii were highly
prized.</p>

<p>The working up of the products of the fisheries formed
an important industry. The fish sauces which so tickled the
palate of ancient epicures, <i>garum</i>,
<i>liquamen</i>, and <i>muria</i>, were produced
here of the finest quality. The making
of them seems to have been practically
a monopoly in the hands of a
certain Umbricius Scaurus; a great
number of earthen jars have been
found with the mark of his ownership
<a href="#Page_506">(p. 506</a>).</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 5.&mdash;An amphora from
Boscoreale.</p>
</div>

<p>The Pompeians turned to account,
also, the volcanic products of Vesuvius.
Pumice stone was an article
of export. From the lava millstones
were made for both grain mills and
oil mills, which were apparently already
in extensive use in the time of
Cato the Elder; he twice mentions
the oil mills of Pompeii. In Pompeii itself the millstones of
the oldest period are of lava from Vesuvius; later it was found
that the lava of Rocca Monfina was better adapted for the purpose,
and millstones of that material were preferred. Small
hand-mills of the lava from Vesuvius were in use at Pompeii
down to 79; but the larger millstones of this material found in
the bakeries had been put one side. In shape and finish the
mills of local make were superior to the more carelessly worked
stones from Rocca Monfina; the preference for the latter was
due to the fact that they contained numerous crystals of leucite,
which broke off as the mill wore away, and so kept the grinding
surfaces always rough. Millstones from Rocca Monfina may
be seen at different places in Rome, as in the Museum of the
Baths of Diocletian.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p>To the sources of revenue which contributed to the prosperity
of Pompeii we may add the presence of wealthy Romans,
who, attracted by the delightful climate, built country seats in
the vicinity. Among them was Cicero, who often speaks of his
Pompeian villa (Pompeianum). That the imperial family also had
a villa here is inferred from a curious accident. We read that
Drusus, the young son of the Emperor Claudius, a few days
after his betrothal to the daughter of Sejanus, was choked to
death at Pompeii by a pear which he had thrown up into the air
and caught in his mouth. These country seats, no doubt, lay
on the high ground back of Pompeii, toward Vesuvius; they
probably faced the sea. But the identification of a villa excavated
in the last century, and then filled up again, as the villa of
Cicero, is wholly without foundation.</p>

<p><i>Salve lucrum</i>, 'Welcome, Gain!' Such is the inscription
which a Pompeian placed in the mosaic floor of his house.
<i>Lucrum gaudium</i>, 'Gain is pure joy,' we read on the threshold
of another house. A thrifty Pompeian certainly did not lack
opportunity to acquire wealth.</p>

<p>How large a population Pompeii possessed at the time of the
destruction of the city it is impossible to determine. A painstaking
examination of all the houses excavated would afford
data for an approximate estimate; but the results thus far obtained
by those who have given attention to the subject are
unsatisfactory. Fiorelli assigned to Pompeii twelve thousand
inhabitants, Nissen twenty thousand. Undoubtedly the second
estimate is nearer the truth than the first; according to all indication
the population may very likely have exceeded twenty
thousand.</p>

<p>This population was by no means homogeneous. The original
Oscan stock had not yet lost its identity; inscriptions in the
Oscan dialect are found scratched on the plaster of walls decorated
in the style prevalent after the earthquake of the year 63.
From the time when the Roman colony was founded no doubt
additions continued to be made to the population from various
parts of Italy. The Greek element was particularly strong.
This is proved by the number of Greek names in the accounts
of Caecilius Jucundus, for example, and by the Greek inscriptions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
that have been found on walls and on amphorae. The
Greeks may have come from the neighboring towns; most of
them were probably freedmen. In a seaport we should expect
to find also Greeks from trans-marine cities; and, in fact, an
Alexandrian appears in one of the receipts of Jucundus. There
were Orientals, too, as we shall see when we come to the temple
of Isis.</p>

<p>Thus far there has come to hand no trustworthy evidence for
the presence of Christians at Pompeii; but traces of Jewish
influence are not lacking. The words <i>Sodoma</i>, <i>Gomora</i>, are
scratched in large letters on the wall of a house in Region IX
(IX. i. 26). They must have been written by a Jew, or possibly
a Christian; they seem like a prophecy of the fate of the city.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig006" id="fig006"></a>
<img src="images/fig006.jpg" width="537" height="175" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 6.&mdash;The Judgment of Solomon. Wall painting.</p>
</div>

<p>Another interesting bit of evidence is a wall painting, which
appears to have as its subject the Judgment of Solomon (<a href="#fig006">Fig. 6</a>).
On a tribunal at the right sits the king with two advisers; the
pavilion is well guarded with soldiers. In front of the tribunal
a soldier is about to cut a child in two with a cleaver. Two
women are represented, one of whom stands at the block and is
already taking hold of the half of the child assigned to her,
while the other casts herself on her knees as a suppliant before
the judges. It is not certain that the reference here is to Solomon;
such tales pass from one country to another, and a somewhat
similar story is told of the Egyptian king Bocchoris. The
balance of probability is in favor of the view that we have here
the Jewish version of the story, because this is consistent with
other facts that point to the existence of a Jewish colony at
Pompeii.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>

<p>The names Maria and Martha appear in wall inscriptions.
The assertion that Maria here is not the Hebrew name, but the
feminine form of the Roman name Marius, is far astray. It
appears in a list of female slaves who were working in a
weaver's establishment, Vitalis, Florentina, Amaryllis, Januaria,
Heracla, Maria, Lalage, Damalis, Doris. The Marian family
was represented at Pompeii, but the Roman name Maria could
not have been given to a slave. That we have here a Jewish
name seems certain since the discovery of the name Martha.</p>

<p>In inscriptions upon wine jars we find mention of a certain
M. Valerius Abinnerichus, a name which is certainly Jewish or
Syrian; but whether Abinnerich was a dealer, or the owner of the
estate on which the wine was produced, cannot be determined.
In this connection it is worth while to note that vessels have
been found with the inscribed labels, <i>gar[um] cast[um]</i> or
<i>cast[imoniale]</i>, and <i>mur[ia] cast[a]</i>. As we learn from Pliny
(N. H. XXXI. viii. 95), these fish sauces, prepared for fast
days, were used especially by the Jews.</p>

<p>Some have thought that the word <i>Christianos</i> can be read in
an inscription written with charcoal, and have fancied that they
found a reference to the persecution of the Christians under
Nero. But charcoal inscriptions, which will last for centuries
when covered with earth, soon become illegible if exposed to
the air; such an inscription, traced on a wall at the time of the
persecutions under Nero, must have disappeared long before the
destruction of the city. The inscription in question was indistinct
when discovered, and has since entirely faded; the reading
is quite uncertain. If it were proved that the word "Christians"
appeared in it, we should be warranted only in the inference
that Christians were known at Pompeii, not that they lived
and worshipped there. According to Tertullian (Apol. 40) there
were no Christians in Campania before 79.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE CITY OVERWHELMED</i></span></h3>

<p>Previous to the terrible eruption of 79, Vesuvius was considered
an extinct volcano. "Above these places," says Strabo,
writing in the time of Augustus, "lies Vesuvius, the sides of
which are well cultivated, even to the summit. This is level,
but quite unproductive. It has a cindery appearance; for the
rock is porous and of a sooty color, the appearance suggesting
that the whole summit may once have been on fire and have
contained craters, the fires of which died out when there was
no longer anything left to burn."</p>

<p>Earthquakes, however, were of common occurrence in Campania.
An especially violent shock on the fifth of February,
63 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>, gave warning of the reawakening of Vesuvius. Great
damage was done throughout the region lying between Naples
and Nuceria, but the shock was most severe at Pompeii, a
large part of the buildings of the city being thrown down. The
prosperous and enterprising inhabitants at once set about rebuilding.
When the final catastrophe came, on the twenty-fourth
of August, 79 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>, most of the houses were in a good
state of repair, and the rebuilding of at least two temples, those
of Apollo and of Isis, had been completed. This renewing of
the city, caused by the earthquake, may be looked upon as a
fortunate circumstance for our studies.</p>

<p>Our chief source of information for the events of August 24-26,
79, is a couple of letters of the Younger Pliny to Tacitus,
who purposed to make use of them in writing his history. Pliny
was staying at Misenum with his uncle, the Elder Pliny, who
was in command of the Roman fleet. In the first letter he tells
of his uncle's fate. On the afternoon of the twenty-fourth, the
admiral Pliny set out with ships to rescue from impending danger
the people at the foot of Vesuvius, particularly in the vicinity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
of Herculaneum. He came too late; it was no longer possible
to effect a landing. So he directed his course to Stabiae, where
he spent the night; and there on the following morning he died,
suffocated by the fumes that were exhaled from the earth.
The second letter gives an account of the writer's own experiences
at Misenum.</p>

<p>To this testimony little is added by the narrative of Dion
Cassius, which was written a century and a half later and is
known to us only in abstract; Dion dwells at greater length on
the powerful impression which the terrible convulsion of nature
left upon those who were living at that time. With the help
of the letters of Pliny, in connection with the facts established
by the excavations, it is possible to picture to ourselves the
progress of the eruption with a fair degree of clearness.</p>

<p>The subterranean fires of Vesuvius pressed upward to find
an outlet. The accumulations of volcanic dust and pumice
stone that had been heaped up on the mountain by former
eruptions were again hurled to a great height, and came down
upon the surrounding country. On the west side of Vesuvius
they mingled with torrents of rain, and flowed as a vast stream
of mud down over Herculaneum. On the south side, driven
by a northwest wind as they descended from the upper air,
they spread out into a thick cloud, which covered Pompeii and
the plain of the Sarno. Out of this cloud first broken fragments
of pumice stone&mdash;the average size not larger than a
walnut&mdash;rained down to the depth of eight to ten feet; then
followed volcanic dust, wet as it fell by a downpour of water, to
the depth of six or seven feet. With the storm of dust came
successive shocks of earthquake.</p>

<p>Such was, in outline, the course of the eruption. It must
have begun early in the morning of the twenty-fourth, and the
stream of mud must have commenced immediately to move in
the direction of Herculaneum; for shortly after one o'clock on
that day the admiral Pliny at Misenum received letters from
the region threatened, saying that the danger was imminent, and
that escape was possible only by sea. Even then the Younger
Pliny saw, high above Vesuvius, the cloud, shaped like an umbrella
pine, which was to rain down destruction on Pompeii.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Toward evening, the ships off Herculaneum ran into the hail of
pumice stone, which, during the night, reached Stabiae and so increased
in violence that the admiral Pliny was obliged to leave
his sleeping room from fear that the door would be blocked up
by the falling masses.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the twenty-fifth there was a severe
shock of earthquake, which was felt as far as Misenum. Then
the dust began to fall, and a cloud of fearful blackness, pierced
through and through with flashes of lightning, settled down
over land and sea. At Misenum, even, it became dark; "not,"
says Pliny, "as on a cloudy night when there is no moon, but
as in a room which has been completely closed."</p>

<p>How long the fall of dust lasted we can only infer from
this, that when it ceased the sun had not yet set. In Misenum,
which the shower of pumice stone had not reached, everything
was covered with a thick layer of dust. Although the earthquake
shocks continued, the inhabitants went back into their
houses. But Pompeii and Stabiae had been covered so deep
that only the roofs of the houses, where these had not fallen in,
projected above the surface; and Herculaneum had wholly
disappeared.</p>

<p>All the plain of the Sarno was buried, as were also the slopes
of the mountains on the south. Stabiae, as we have seen, lay at
the foot of the mountains, on the coast. It had been destroyed
by Sulla in the Social War; its inhabitants, forced to scatter,
settled in the surrounding country. In the years 1749-82
numerous buildings were excavated in the vicinity, in part luxurious
country seats, in part plain farm buildings; but the excavations
were afterward filled up again. The covering of
Stabiae was like that of Pompeii, only not so deep.</p>

<p>Herculaneum was covered with the same materials; they
were not, however, deposited in regular strata, but were mixed
together, and being drenched with water, hardened into a kind
of tufa which in places reaches a depth of sixty-five feet. Excavating
at Herculaneum is in consequence extremely difficult;
and the difficulty is further increased by the fact that a modern
city, Resina, extends over the greater part of the ancient site.
The excavations thus far attempted have in most cases been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
conducted by means of underground passageways. The statement
that Herculaneum was overflowed by a stream of lava,
though frequently repeated, is erroneous.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig007" id="fig007"></a>
<img src="images/fig007.jpg" width="450" height="304" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 7.&mdash;Cast of a man.</p>
</div>
<p>The woodwork of buildings in Pompeii has in many cases
been preserved, but in a completely charred condition. Frequently
where walls were painted with yellow ochre it has
turned red, especially when brought immediately into contact
with the stratum of dust&mdash;a change which this color undergoes
when it is exposed to heat. Nevertheless, the inference
would be unwarranted that the products of the eruption fell
upon the city red-hot and caused a general conflagration. The
fragments of pumice stone could scarcely have retained a great
degree of heat after having been so long in the air; it is evident
from Pliny's narrative that they were not hot.</p>

<p>With the dust a copious rain must have fallen; for the
bodies of those who perished in the storm of dust left perfect
moulds, into a number of which soft plaster of Paris has been
poured, making those casts of human figures which lend a
melancholy interest to the collections in the little Museum
at Pompeii (<a href="#fig007">Fig. 7</a>). The extraordinary freshness of these
figures, without any suggestion of the wasting away after death,
is explicable only on the supposition that the enveloping dust
was damp, and so commenced immediately to harden into a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
permanent shape. If the dust had been dry and had packed
down and hardened afterwards, we should be able to trace at
least the beginnings of decay.</p>

<p>Neither the pumice stone nor the dust, then, could have set
wood on fire. The woodwork must have become charred gradually
from the effect of moisture, as in the case of coal, and the
change in the color of the yellow ochre must be due to some
other cause than the presence of heat. This is all the more
evident from the fact that vestiges of local conflagrations, confined
within narrow limits, can here and there be traced, kindled
by the masses of glowing slag which fell at the same time with
the pumice stone, or by the fires left burning in the houses.</p>

<p>From the number of skeletons discovered in the past few
decades, since an accurate record has been kept, it has been
estimated that in Pompeii itself, about two thousand persons
perished. As the city contained a population of twenty thousand
or more, it is evident that the majority of the inhabitants
fled; since the eruption commenced in the morning, while the
hail of pumice stone did not begin till afternoon, those who
appreciated the greatness of the danger had time to escape. It
is, however, impossible to say how many fled when it was
already too late, and lost their lives outside the city. Mention
has already been made of some who perished at the harbor;
others who went out earlier to the Sarno may have made good
their escape. Of those who remained in the city part were
buried in the houses&mdash;so with twenty persons whose skeletons
were found in the cellar of the villa of Diomedes; others, as
the hail of pumice stone ceased, ventured out into the streets,
where they soon succumbed to the shower of dust that immediately
followed. As the bodies wasted away little except the
bones was left in the hollows formed by the dust that hardened
around them, and the casts already referred to, which have been
made from time to time since 1863, give in some cases a remarkably
clear and sharp representation of the victims.</p>

<p>The Emperor Titus sent a commission of senators into Campania
to report in what way help could best be rendered. A
plan was formed to rebuild the cities that had been destroyed,
and the property of those who died without heirs was set aside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
for this purpose. Nothing came of it, however, so far as our
knowledge goes. Pompeii is indeed mentioned in the Peutinger
Table, a map for travellers made in the third century, but the
name was apparently given to a post station in memory of the
former city. Conclusive evidence against the existence of a
new city is the absence of any inscriptions referring to it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE UNEARTHING OF THE CITY</i></span></h3>

<p>The first excavations at Pompeii were undertaken by the
survivors shortly after the destruction of the city. As the
upper parts of the houses that had not fallen in projected above
the surface, it was possible to locate the places under which
objects of value were buried. Men dug down from the surface
at certain points and tunnelled from room to room underneath,
breaking through the intervening walls. This work was facilitated
by the stratification of the volcanic deposit; the loose
bits of pumice stone in the lower stratum were easily removed,
while the stratum of dust above was compact enough to furnish
a fairly safe roof for narrow passageways. Only infrequently
is a house discovered that was left undisturbed; from
this we understand why comparatively little household furniture
of value has been found. Not only were rich house furnishings
in demand,&mdash;the excavators carried away valuable building
materials as well. So eagerly were these sought after that
large buildings, as those about the Forum, were almost completely
stripped of their marble.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages Pompeii was quite forgotten. Possibly
some remains of the ancient buildings were yet to be seen; at
any rate it seems to have been believed that a city once existed
there, for the site was called La Civita.</p>

<p>In the years 1594-1600 Domenico Fontana was bringing
water from one of the springs of the Sarno to Torre Annunziata,
and in the course of the work cut an underground
channel through the site of Pompeii and discovered two
inscriptions; but no further investigations were made. The
indifference of Fontana may be explained by the fact that the
water channel was not dug out from above, like a railway
cutting, and then covered over, but was carried as a tunnel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
through the hill on which the city stood, so that the workmen
came to the ancient surface at only a few points. In the
part now excavated, the original level was disturbed in but
one place, near the temple of Zeus Milichius; here the inscriptions
were probably found.</p>

<p>The excavation of the buried Campanian towns began, not at
Pompeii, but at Herculaneum, where in 1709 the workmen of
the Austrian general, Count Elbeuf, sunk a shaft, reaching the
ancient level at the rear of the stage of the theatre. The
current statement that Elbeuf discovered the site of Herculaneum
by accident, his workmen being engaged in digging a
well, is erroneous. The location of the city was already known,
and Elbeuf was searching for antiquities. The error probably
originated in a misunderstanding of the Italian word <i>pozzo</i>,
which has a double meaning, "shaft," and "well."</p>

<p>At first little was accomplished, but after 1738 excavations
were carried on by King Charles III in a more systematic
manner. The director of these excavations, Rocco Gioacchino
de Alcubierre, in March, 1748, had occasion to inspect the
water channel mentioned above, and learned that at the place
called La Civita&mdash;which he thought was Stabiae&mdash;objects of
antiquity were often found. He came to the conclusion
that this site was more promising than that of Herculaneum,
where the excavations just then were yielding little of value;
the result of his recommendation was that on the thirtieth of
the same month excavations were commenced at Pompeii, with
twelve workmen.</p>

<p>The first digging was done north of Nola Street, near the
Casa del Torello; then the men were set at work on the Street
of Tombs, near the Herculaneum Gate; and a part of the
Amphitheatre also was cleared. In 1750 the work was stopped,
because the results were thought to be unimportant.</p>

<p>Attention was again directed to Pompeii in 1754, when workmen
engaged in constructing the highway that runs just south
of the city discovered a number of tombs. About the same
time, west of the Amphitheatre, the extensive establishment of
Julia Felix, arranged like a villa, and some buildings lying north
of it, were excavated; but they were all covered up again, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
was also the so-called villa of Cicero, which was uncovered in
1763.</p>

<p>The parts excavated were not left clear until after 1763, when
the discovery of the inscription of Suedius Clemens, on the
Street of Tombs, had established the fact that the site was that
of Pompeii. Important discoveries were made soon after. In
the years immediately following 1764 the theatres, with the
adjacent buildings, and the Street of Tombs, together with the
villa of Diomedes, were laid bare. The excavations were conducted
slowly and without system, yet with scientific interest
fostered by the Herculaneum Academy (Accademia ercolanese),
which had been founded in 1755.</p>

<p>Under Joseph Bonaparte and Murat, 1806-15, the work
received larger appropriations, and was prosecuted with greater
energy, particularly in the quarter lying between the Herculaneum
Gate and the Forum. In the same period the Forum was
approached from the south side also. In 1799, at the time of
the Parthenopean Republic, the French general Championnet
had excavated, south of the Basilica, the two houses which are still
called by his name. From these, in 1813, the excavators made
their way into the Basilica, whence, in November of the same
year, they pushed forward into the Forum. However, the
excavation of the Forum itself with the surrounding buildings,
prosecuted less vigorously and with limited means in the period
of the Restoration, was not completed till 1825; by this time
the temple of Fortuna and the Baths north of the Forum had
also been uncovered. The following years, to 1832, brought to
light the beautiful houses on the north side of Nola Street&mdash;the
houses of Pansa, of the Tragic Poet, and of the Faun&mdash;and
those on Mercury Street; later came excavations south of
Nola Street and in various parts of the city.</p>

<p>The disturbances of the period of Revolution caused a cessation
of work for two years, from July 3, 1848, to September 27,
1850. During the next nine years effort was expended chiefly
in clearing Stabian Street and the Stabian Baths.</p>

<p>The fall of the Bourbon dynasty and the passing over of
Naples to the Kingdom of Italy caused another interruption,
which lasted a year, from December 5, 1859, to December 20,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
1860. On the last date the excavations were resumed under the
direction of Giuseppe Fiorelli, a man of marked individuality,
who left a permanent impress upon every part of the work.
To him is due the present admirable system, excellent alike from
the technical and from the administrative point of view. We
owe it to him, that better provision is made now than
formerly for the preservation and care of excavated buildings
and objects discovered; the earlier efforts in this direction
naturally left room for improvement, and the painstaking of the
present administration is especially worthy of commendation.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig008" id="fig008"></a>
<img src="images/fig008.jpg" width="536" height="431" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 8.&mdash;An excavation. Atrium of the house of the Silver Wedding, cleared in the
autumn of 1892.</p>
</div>

<p>Fiorelli put an end to haphazard digging, to excavating here
and there wherever the site seemed most promising. He first
set about clearing the undisturbed places lying between the
excavated portions; and when in this way the west part of
the city had been laid bare, he commenced to work systematically
from the excavated part toward the east. Since 1860 only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
one public building has been excavated&mdash;the baths at the
corner of Stabian and Nola streets; but many private houses
have been uncovered, some of which are of much interest.
Fiorelli remained in charge of the excavations until 1875, when
he was called to Rome to become General Director of Museums
and Excavations; he died in 1896, at the age of seventy-two.
His successors, first Michele Ruggiero, then Giulio de Petra,
have worked according to his plans, and in full sympathy with
his ideals.</p>

<p>Up to the present time about three-fifths of Pompeii have been
excavated. In 1872 Fiorelli made the calculation that if the
excavations should continue at the rate then followed the whole
city would be laid bare in 74 years. Since that time the work
has progressed more slowly, partly in consequence of the
greater care taken for the preservation of the remains. At
the present rate of progress we may believe that the twentieth
century will hardly witness the completion of the excavations.</p>

<p>Articles of furniture and objects of art that can easily be
moved, as the statuettes often found in the gardens, are ordinarily
taken to the Museum in Naples; a few things have been
placed in the little Museum at Pompeii. Now and then small
sculptures have been left in a house exactly as they were found;
but the necessity of keeping such houses locked and of guarding
them with especial care prevents the general adoption of
this method of preservation.</p>

<p>In respect to the preservation of paintings the practice has
varied at different periods. Generally, however, the best
pictures have been cut from the walls and transferred to the
Museum, while the decorative framework has been left undisturbed.
It is keenly to be regretted that in this way the effect
of the decorative system as a whole has been destroyed, for
the picture forms the centre of a carefully elaborated scheme
of decoration which needs to be viewed as an artistic whole
in order to be fully appreciated; and the removal of a
painting can hardly be accomplished without some damage to
the parts of the wall immediately in contact with it. A far
better method would be to leave intact all walls containing
paintings or decorative work of interest, providing such means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
of protection against the weather as may be necessary. A
good beginning in this respect has been made in the case
of the house of the Vettii, the beautiful and well preserved
paintings of which have been left on the walls and are preserved
with the greatest care.</p>

<p>The treatment of a mosaic floor is an altogether different
problem. While the floor as a whole, with its ornamental
designs, is left in place, fine mosaics representing paintings,
which are delicate and easily destroyed, are wisely taken up
and placed in the Museum.</p>

<h3>NOTES TO PLAN I</h3>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>The Regions are given as they were laid out by Fiorelli (<a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a>), the
boundaries being marked by broken lines. The Insulae are designated by
Arabic numerals.</p>

<p>Stabian Street, between Stabian and Vesuvius gates, separating Regions
VIII, VII, and VI, from I, IX, and V, is often called Cardo, from analogy
with the <i>cardo maximus</i> (the north and south line) of a Roman camp. Nola
Street, leading from the Nola Gate, with its continuations (Strada della
Fortuna, south of Insulae 10, 12, 13, and 14 of Region VI, and Strada
della Terme, south of VI, 4, 6, 8), was for similar reasons designated as the
Greater Decuman, <i>Decumanus Maior</i>; while the street running from the
Water Gate to the Sarno Gate (Via Marina, Abbondanza Street, Strada dei
Diadumeni) is called the Lesser Decuman, <i>Decumanus Minor</i>.</p>

<p>The only Regions wholly excavated are VII and VIII; but only a small
portion of Region VI remains covered.</p>

<p>The towers of the city wall are designated by numbers, as they are supposed
to have been at the time of the siege of Sulla, in 89 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> <a href="#Page_240">(p. 240</a>).</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="s08"><i>A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW</i></span></h3>

<p>The outline of Pompeii, with its network of streets, may be
traced on the accompanying plan.</p>

<p>The city took its shape from the end of the old lava stream on
which it lay, which ran southeast from Vesuvius. It formed an
irregular oval a little less than four fifths of a mile (1200 metres)
long and a little more than two fifths of a mile (720 metres) wide
in its greatest dimensions. On three sides, west, south, and east,
the wall of the city ran along the edge of the hill; on the northwest
side, between the Herculaneum and Capua gates, it passed
directly across the ridge formed by the lava.</p>

<p>The eight gates are known by the modern names given on our
plan. Two of them, the Herculaneum and Capua gates, lie at
the points where the wall comes to the edge of the lava bed on
either side; the streets that led from them descended to the
plain. At the Herculaneum Gate the much travelled highway
from Naples, passing through Herculaneum, entered the city;
the Capua Gate does not seem to have been built to accommodate
a large traffic. Between these two lay the Vesuvius Gate,
through which the Pompeians passed out upon the ridge toward
Vesuvius.</p>

<p>From the Herculaneum Gate nearly to the Stabian Gate,
on the south side, ran a bluff, with a sharp descent. Nevertheless,
as a gate was needed on the side nearest the sea,
the Water Gate, Porta Marina, was placed here; through it a
steep road led to the Forum, so steep that it could not have been
much used by vehicles; but that may have mattered little to the
fishermen bringing their catches to the market.</p>

<p>The Stabian Gate lay in a depression at the end of the lava
bed and afforded a more convenient means of access to the city;
thence a road ran to the harbor on the Sarno, and to Stabiae.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
At the left another road apparently branched off from this in
the direction of Nuceria, which could be reached also from the
conveniently located Nocera Gate further east; here also the
slope of the hill was less pronounced. Two gates, finally, gave
access to the city on the somewhat steeper east and northeast
sides, the Sarno Gate, which takes its name, not from the river,
but from the modern town of Sarno, and the Nola Gate; it is at
least probable that the road passing through the latter led to
Nola.</p>

<p>A glance at the plan will make it plain that the streets of
Pompeii must have been laid out according to a definite system;
an arrangement on the whole so regular and symmetrical would
scarcely be found in a city that had developed gradually from a
small beginning, in which the location of streets had been the
result of accident.</p>

<p>Two wide streets that cross the city very nearly at right angles
give the direction for the other streets running approximately
north and south and east and west, Mercury Street with its continuations,
and Nola Street. The former probably served as a
base line in laying out the city; this we infer from the fact that
while it is exceptionally broad, and the Forum lies on it, there is
no gate at either end, and it could have been little used for traffic.
Nola Street has a gate only at the east end; the west end opens
into the Strada Consolare, which follows the line of the city wall
and leads to the Herculaneum Gate at the northwest corner. That
the other streets must have taken their direction from these two
is clearly seen in the case of those in the northwest part of the
city; on close examination it will be found that the arrangement
of the rest also is in accordance with the same system, a fact
which would perhaps be still more obvious if the unexcavated
eastern portion of the city were laid bare.</p>

<p>In two instances, however, there is a deviation from this system.
One is in the quarter near the Forum. For reasons which have
not been satisfactorily explained, the Porta Marina was not placed
on the prolongation of the street coming from the Sarno Gate,
but further north. In order to reach this gate the street, as shown
on the plan, makes a bend to the north which is reproduced in
the other east and west streets lying south of Nola Street; west
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
of the Forum, again, the streets converge in order to give access
to this gate.</p>

<p>The other deviation, which affects Stabian Street, can be
explained on grounds of convenience. This street, which runs
from the Stabian to the Vesuvius Gate, abandoned the line of
the north and south streets west of it in order to take advantage
of a natural depression in the hill, by following which an
easy grade could be established to the higher parts of the city;
that the blocks along this important thoroughfare might not be
too irregular in shape, the nearest parallel streets on the east were
laid out in such a way as to follow the direction of Stabian Street.
The street running south from the Capua Gate resumes, with
slight variation, the north and south line of Mercury Street.</p>

<p>The public buildings of the city form two extensive groups.
One group lies about the Forum (<a href="#plan2">Plan II</a>); with this we may
reckon the Baths in the first block north, and the temples of
Fortuna Augusta and Venus Pompeiana. The nucleus of the
other is formed by the two theatres and the large quadrangular
colonnade which, designed originally to afford protection for
theatre-goers against the rain, was later turned into barracks for
the gladiators (<a href="#plan3">Plan III</a>). There are in addition only four
public buildings that need to be mentioned. Two are bathing
establishments, the Stabian Baths, and those at the corner of
Stabian and Nola streets. The third is a small building near
the Herculaneum Gate, consisting of a hall opening on the
street, with a base for a statue near the rear wall; this on insufficient
grounds has been called a custom-house. The fourth,
the Amphitheatre, lies in the southern corner of the city.</p>

<p>As the public buildings were thus located in clearly defined
groups, it is not probable that many yet remain in the portion of
the city which has not been excavated. We may expect to find
only bathing establishments, and perhaps one or two temples.
There were priestesses of Ceres and of Venus, but the sanctuary
of Ceres has not been discovered. Mention is made also of a
priest of Mars; but the temple of Mars, according to the precept
of Vitruvius (I. vii. 1) would be outside the city.</p>

<p>A word should be added regarding the modern division of
Pompeii into Regions, or wards, and Insulae. By an Insula is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
meant&mdash;in accordance with ancient usage&mdash;a block of houses
surrounded on all sides by streets. The division into Regions
was introduced by Fiorelli, and rests upon a misconception which
has been corrected by more recent excavations. Fiorelli thought
that the Capua Gate and the Nocera Gate were connected by a
street, and that the city was thus divided by four streets (the
assumed street, Stabian Street, Nola Street, and Abbondanza
Street with its continuations) into nine Regions, marked on our
plan with the numerals I-IX.</p>

<p>In each Region every block, or Insula, has its number, and in
the Insula a separate number is given to every door opening on
a street. This arrangement is convenient because each house
can be accurately designated by means of three numbers.</p>

<p>On the plans the Insulae are designated by Arabic numerals,
but in the text small Roman numerals are used for the sake of
clearness; thus, Ins. IX. i. 26, means the first Insula of Region
IX, No. 26.</p>

<p>The names of several of the more important streets, as of the
better known houses, are given in the text in the English form.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="chap_vi" id="chap_vi">CHAPTER VI</a><br />

<span class="s08"><i>BUILDING MATERIALS, CONSTRUCTION, AND
ARCHITECTURAL PERIODS</i></span></h3>

<p>Six centuries lie between the dates of the earliest and the
latest buildings at Pompeii; and in order to understand any
structure rightly we must first of all ascertain to what period
it belongs. It is indeed rarely possible to fix dates with exactness
for the earlier time; but certain periods are so clearly differentiated
from one another, that in most cases there is no
room for doubt to which of them a building is to be assigned.
Before undertaking to characterize these periods, however, it
will be necessary briefly to notice what building materials were
used, and how they were turned to account in construction.</p>

<p>Exclusive of wood, which was more freely used in Pompeii
than in Campanian towns to-day, the principal building materials
were Sarno limestone, two kinds of tufa (gray and yellow),
lava, a whitish limestone often called travertine wrongly, marble,
and brick.</p>

<p>The Sarno limestone (<i>pietra di Sarno</i>) is a deposit from the
water of the Sarno, and is found in beds along the course of the
river. It contains many impressions of the leaves and stems of
plants, and varies greatly in compactness; it closely resembles
the Roman travertine, except that it has a more decided yellowish
tint.</p>

<p>Gray tufa is a volcanic dust which has been hardened by the
presence of water into rock. It has a fine grain, and is easily
worked; it was quarried in the vicinity of Nocera. The volcanic
dust which formed the yellow tufa was thrown out in an earlier
period, when the Sarno plain was still a part of the sea, and so
hardened in salt water; it is more friable than the gray tufa,
and not so durable.</p>

<p>The lava, which came originally from Vesuvius, was quarried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
at Pompeii. Three varieties may be distinguished, differing in
density according as they were taken from the lower or the
upper strata: solid lava, or basalt, which, being heavy and
extremely hard, was extensively used for pavements and thresholds;
slag, like the scoriae found on the sides of Vesuvius
to-day; and cruma, the foam of the lava stream, which is light
and porous, but on account of its hardness has good resisting
qualities.</p>

<p>The whitish limestone has a fine texture, without impressions
of leaves, and is of an even color; it was to some extent
employed as a substitute for marble. It was not quarried at
Pompeii, and was not extensively used; the most important
example of its use is in the later colonnade about the Forum.
The white Carrara marble (<i>marmor lunense</i>) was preferred for
columns, pilasters, and architraves; but colored marbles of
many varieties, cut into thin slabs and blocks, were used as a
veneering for walls and in the mosaic floors.</p>

<p>Bricks were used only for the corners of buildings, for doorposts,
and in a few instances, as in the Basilica and the house
of the Labyrinth, for columns; brick walls are not found in
Pompeii. The bricks seen in corners and doorposts (<a href="#fig011">Figs. 11</a>, <a href="#fig095">95</a>)
are simply a facing for rubble work. They are ordinarily less
than an inch thick; they have the shape of a right-angled
triangle, and are so laid that the side representing the hypothenuse&mdash;about
six inches long&mdash;appears in the surface of the
wall. Sometimes fragments of roof tiles, more or less irregular
in shape, were used instead. The bricks of the earlier time
contain sea sand and have a granular surface, with a less
uniform color; the later bricks are smooth and even in
appearance.</p>

<p>The flat oblong roof tiles (<i>tegulae</i>), measuring ordinarily 24 by
19 or 20 inches, had flanges at the sides; over the joints where
the flanges came together, joint tiles in the form of a half-cylinder
(<i>imbrices</i>) were laid, like those in use at the present
day (<a href="#fig114">Figs. 114</a>, <a href="#fig117">117</a>).</p>

<p>The styles of masonry are characteristic and interesting.
We may distinguish them as masonry with limestone framework,
rubble work, reticulate work, quasi-reticulate work, ashlar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
work, and, in the case of columns and entablatures, massive
construction.</p>

<p>The masonry with limestone framework dates from the
earliest period. The walls were built without mortar, clay
being used instead. Since this served only as a filling, without
strength as a binding material, it was necessary to arrange the
stones themselves in such a way that the wall would stand firm.
This result was accomplished by using large, oblong blocks, not
only for corners and doorposts, but also for a framework in the
body of the wall; as shown in our illustration, alternate vertical
and horizontal blocks were built up into pillars which would
hold in place the courses of smaller stones that filled the intervening
spaces. The material of the larger, hewn blocks, as well
as of the smaller fragments, was Sarno limestone, with occasional
pieces of cruma or slag.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig009" id="fig009"></a>
<img src="images/fig009.jpg" width="399" height="302" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 9.&mdash;Wall with limestone framework.</p>
</div>

<p>The rubble work, <i>opus incertum</i>, consists of fragments irregular
in shape, of the size of the fist and larger, laid in mortar.
The material used in the earlier times was ordinarily lava;
later, Sarno limestone. Corners and doorposts at first were
built of hewn blocks; afterwards bricks and blocks of stone cut
in the form of bricks were used for this purpose, and in the
latest period frequently brick and stone combined, <i>opus mixtum</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
or <i>opus compositum</i>&mdash;a course of stone alternating with every
two or three courses of brick. An example of the <i>opus mixtum</i>
is seen in the entrances of the Herculaneum Gate (<a href="#fig113">Fig. 113</a>).
Rubble work is the prevailing masonry at Pompeii; in comparison
the other kinds described may be considered exceptional.</p>

<p>The reticulate work, <i>opus reticulatum</i>, formed the outer surface
of a wall, the inner part of which was built up with rubble.
It was composed of small four-sided pyramidal blocks, of which
only the base, cut square and smooth, showed on the surface;
the tapering part served as a key to bind the block into the
wall. These blocks, which measured from three to four inches
square at the base, were laid on their corners, so that the edges
ran diagonally to the horizontal and vertical lines of the wall;
the pattern thus formed had the appearance of a net, hence the
name. The material was in most cases gray, occasionally
yellow, tufa. The corners and doorposts were at first made of
the same kind of stone cut in the shape of bricks; later of
bricks. This style of masonry was in vogue at Rome, and
apparently also at Pompeii, in the time of Augustus (<a href="#fig012">Fig.
12</a>; see also the pedestal in the foreground of <a href="#plate01">Plate I</a>).</p>

<p>The quasi-reticulate work belongs to the early years of the
Roman colony. In appearance it lies between rubble and reticulate
work, differing from the latter in that the small blocks are
less carefully finished and are laid with less regularity. The
material is generally lava, but tufa and limestone are also found.
The corners and doorposts are of brick, or of brick-shaped
blocks of tufa or limestone (<a href="#fig011">Fig. 11</a>).</p>

<p>Ashlar work, of carefully hewn oblong blocks laid in courses,
is found in the older portions of the city wall (<a href="#fig109">Fig. 109</a>) and in
the walls of the Greek temple in the Forum Triangulare; it
was used otherwise only for the fronts of houses (<a href="#fig010">Fig. 10</a>). The
material in the earliest times was Sarno limestone, later gray
tufa. With the coming of the Roman colony ashlar work went
out of use, even for the corners of houses and doorposts.</p>

<p>In the construction of columns and many architraves large
blocks were used. Previous to the time of the Roman colony
these were of gray tufa, or, in rare instances, of limestone; a
coating of white stucco was laid on the surface. From the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
advent of the colony to the time of the Early Empire, the
whitish limestone was used; after that, Carrara marble.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the styles of construction just described, we
may now turn to the architectural history of Pompeii, which, as
we shall see, falls naturally into six periods.</p>

<p>The first period is that to which the Doric temple in the
Forum Triangulare and the city walls belong. From the style
of the temple, we may safely conclude that it was built in the
sixth century <span class="s08">B.C.</span>; the evidence is too scanty to enable us
definitely to fix the date of the
walls. The building materials
used were the Sarno limestone
and gray tufa.</p>

<p>The second period may be
designated as the Period of the
Limestone Atriums, so characterized
from the peculiar
construction of a number of
houses found in different parts
of the city. On the side facing
the street these houses have
walls of ashlar work of Sarno
limestone (<a href="#fig010">Fig. 10</a>), but the
inner walls are of limestone
framework (<a href="#fig009">Fig. 9</a>).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 278px;"><a name="fig010" id="fig010"></a>
<img src="images/fig010.jpg" width="278" height="444" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 10.&mdash;Façade of Sarno limestone,
house of the Surgeon.</p>
</div>

<p>Almost no ornamental forms
belonging to this period have
come down to us; so far only a
single column has been found,
built into the wall of a house.
It is of the Doric style, and
once formed part of a portico that ran along the west side of
the small open space at the northwest corner of Stabian and
Nola streets; it is thus the sole remnant of a public building.
In the only complete house that has survived from this
period, the house of the Surgeon, there was a portico in front
of the garden, but the roof was supported by square pillars,
not by columns. There is no trace of wall painting.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>Characteristic as the construction of the limestone atriums is,
it is difficult to determine to what age they belong. The beginning
of the period cannot be determined even approximately.
The end, however, is fixed by the earlier limit of the
next period, the Second Punic War. We may, therefore,
assign the houses with the limestone atriums to a period just
preceding this war; reckoning in round numbers, they were
built before 200 <span class="s08">B.C.</span></p>

<p>In the third, or Tufa Period, came the climax of the development
of Pompeian architecture prior to the Roman domination.
The favorite building material was the gray tufa.</p>

<p>With the exception of the Greek temple mentioned above,
all the public buildings of Pompeii that do not belong to the
time of the Roman colony have a homogeneous character; a
list of them would include the colonnade about the Forum, the
Basilica, the temples of Apollo and of Jupiter, the Large
Theatre with the colonnades of the Forum Triangulare and
the Barracks of the Gladiators, the Stabian Baths, the Palaestra,
and the outer part of the Porta Marina with the inner parts
of the other gates. Closely associated with these public edifices
is a large number of private houses; as a specially characteristic
example, we may mention the house of the Faun.</p>

<p>All these buildings are similar in style and construction;
they evidently date from a period of great building activity.
It must also have been a period of peace and prosperity; for
the whole city, from the artistic and monumental point of view,
underwent a transformation. Certain Oscan inscriptions, an
early Latin monumental inscription, and a few words, dating
from 78 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, scratched upon the plaster of the Basilica, oblige
us to place the Tufa Period before the time of the Roman
colony; yet not long before, for the next oldest buildings date
from the first years of the colony. The time of peace that
furnished the background for the period can only have been
that between the Second Punic War and the Social War, about
200 to 90 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>; the Tufa Period was approximately the second
century before Christ.</p>

<p>In marked contrast with the Period of the Limestone Atriums,
the Tufa Period has a pronounced artistic character. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
preëminently a period of monumental construction. Buildings
and public places are adorned with colonnades of the Doric,
Ionic, and Corinthian orders. The simple and beautiful forms
of the Greek architecture are used, sparingly indeed, but
without petty detail and with evident fear of excessive ornamentation.
Columns and architraves are white, with only slight
suggestion of the earlier Greek polychrome decoration. A
variety of color, however, is laid on the walls, and with this
period the history of Pompeian wall decoration begins.</p>

<p>The Tufa Period coincides throughout with the time of
the first style of decoration. This, known as the Incrustation
Style, aimed to imitate in stucco the appearance of a wall
veneered with colored marbles. Wall paintings are wholly lacking,
but pictures, often of rare beauty, are found in the mosaics
of the floors. In this period, we may truly say that Pompeian
architecture was at its best. With it the pure Greek tradition
dies out; all the buildings of later times bear the Roman
stamp.</p>

<p>The buildings of the Tufa Period are easily recognized by
the unobtrusiveness of the materials used in their construction.
The rubble work is mostly of lava; but gray tufa was used
exclusively, not only for ashlar work in façades, but also for
columns and entablatures. The surface of the tufa was coated
with a layer of fine white stucco, which gave it the appearance
of marble. The use of marble for building purposes, however,
is foreign to this period; and it speaks well for the culture of
the Oscan Pompeians that they had pleasure in beauty of form
above richness of material.</p>

<p>The fourth period covers the earlier decades of the Roman
colony, from 80 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> to near the end of the Republic. According
to inscriptions which are still extant, soon after the year
80 a wealthy colonist, Gaius Quinctius Valgus, when duumvir
with Marcus Porcius as colleague, built the Small Theatre, and
afterwards, when quinquennial duumvir with the same colleague,
the Amphitheatre also. Both structures have the quasi-reticulate
facing (<a href="#fig011">Fig. 11</a>); and several other buildings in which
the same style of masonry is found without doubt belong to
the same period&mdash;the Baths near the Forum, the temple of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
Zeus Milichius, a building just inside the Porta Marina, and
apparently the hall at the southeast corner of the Forum,
which we shall identify as the Comitium; with these should
be included also the original temple of Isis, which was destroyed
by the earthquake of 63 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> Few houses dating from this
period have been discovered; the provision made by the preceding
period in this respect had been so generous that new
houses were not needed.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 253px;"><a name="fig011" id="fig011"></a>
<img src="images/fig011.jpg" width="253" height="281" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 11.&mdash;Quasi-reticulate facing, with
brick corner, at the entrance of the
Small Theatre.</p>
</div>

<p>From the aesthetic point of view the fourth period falls far
below that just preceding; the exhaustion of resources and the
decline of taste due to the long and terrible war are unmistakable.
Theatre, Amphitheatre, and
Baths were alike built for immediate
use, with crude and scanty
ornamentation; and where
richer ornament was applied, as
in the case of the temple of Isis,
it could not for a moment be
compared with that of the Tufa
Period in beauty and finish.</p>

<p>The wall decoration of the
fourth period is of the second
Pompeian style, which came into
vogue just after the founding of
the colony, and which we shall
call the Architectural Style; for
in part, as the first style, it imitated
a veneering of marble, not however with the help of slabs
or panels modelled in stucco, but by the use of color only, laid
on walls finished to a plane surface; in part it made use of
architectural designs which were painted either correctly or
with at least some regard for proper proportions.</p>

<p>The fifth period extends from the last decades of the Republic
to the earthquake of the year 63 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> In the entire period,
covering more than a century, we are unable to distinguish a
series of buildings which may be classed together in style and
construction as constituting a homogeneous, representative
group. Here and there we can point out a piece of masonry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
which, from its similarity to that of the fourth period, may be
assigned to the end of the Republic; again, walls with reticulate
facing of tufa and corners of brick-shaped blocks of the
same stone belong to the time of Augustus (<a href="#fig012">Fig. 12</a>), while reticulate
work with corners of brick (<a href="#fig095">Fig. 95</a>) is of later date; but
there is a total lack of those distinguishing characteristics which
would serve to set off by themselves all the buildings belonging
to a particular time. Consequently in the case of each structure
it is necessary to take into account all the circumstances,
and then to form an independent judgment regarding its style
and date.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig012" id="fig012"></a>
<img src="images/fig012.jpg" width="399" height="359" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 12.&mdash;Reticulate facing, with corners of brick-shaped stone. The filled arch is
probably to bear the weight of the wall over a sewer.</p>
</div>

<p>The difficulty is further enhanced by the fact that three styles
of wall decoration fall within the limits of the same period.
The Architectural Style, already mentioned, remained in vogue
to the time of Augustus; it then gave place to the third or
Ornate Style, which is characterized by a freer use of ornament
and the introduction of designs and scenes suggestive of an
Egyptian origin. The fourth or Intricate Style came in about
the year 50 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>, and represents, with its involved and fantastic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
designs, the last stage in the development of Pompeian wall
decoration. In the fifth period marble began to be employed
as a building material; the earliest dated example of its use is
the temple of Fortuna Augusta, erected about 3 <span class="s08">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The sixteen years between the earthquake of 63 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> and the
destruction of the city form the sixth period in the architectural
history of Pompeii. The buildings belonging to it can be easily
recognized, not only from their similarity in style and ornament,
but also from certain external characteristics, as newness of appearance,
unfinished condition, and the joining of new to broken
walls. The only important building wholly new is the large
bathing establishment, the Central Baths, at the corner of
Stabian and Nola streets. For the rest, effort seems to have
been directed toward restoring the ruined buildings as nearly as
possible to their original condition. The wall decoration
throughout is of the Intricate Style.</p>

<p>The measurements of buildings in the Roman Period conform
to the scale of the Roman foot, while the dimensions of
structures antedating the Roman colony in most cases reduce
to the scale of the Oscan or old Italic foot. The Roman foot
(296 mm.) may be roughly reckoned at 0.97 of the English foot
(304.8 mm.); the Oscan foot (275 mm.) is considerably shorter.
As the Roman standard is of Greek origin, we may perhaps find
a structure conforming to it that was designed by a Greek
architect before the Roman Period.</p>

<h2>PART I<br />

PUBLIC PLACES AND BUILDINGS</h2>

<h3 class="chap1">CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE FORUM</i></span></h3>

<p>The Forum is usually approached from the west side by the
short, steep street leading from the Porta Marina. Entering,
we find ourselves near the lower end of an oblong open space
(<a href="#plate01">Plate I</a>), at the upper end of which, toward Vesuvius, stands
a high platform of masonry with the ruins of a temple&mdash;the
temple of Jupiter; the remains of a colonnade are seen on
each of the other three sides. Including the colonnade the
Forum measures approximately 497 feet in length by 156 in
breadth; without it the dimensions are 467 and 126 feet. The
north side, at the left of the temple, is enclosed by a wall in
which there are two openings, one at the end of the colonnade,
the other between this and the temple; at the right the wall
bounding the open space has been replaced by a stately commemorative
arch, while the end of the colonnade is closed by
a wall with a passageway. Another arch, of much simpler
construction, stands at the left of the temple, in line with
the façade; it cuts off the area between the temple and the
colonnade from the rest of the Forum. A third arch once stood
in a corresponding position at the right.</p>

<p>The colonnade is nowhere intersected by a street passable for
vehicles. Even the entrances on the north side form no exception.
At the left you descend to the area by several steps, at
the right by one only; yet here the exclusion of carts and wagons
was made doubly sure by placing three upright stones in the
passageway. Only pedestrians could enter the Forum, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
they, too, could easily be shut out by means of gates in the
entrances; the places where the gates swung can still be seen
in the pavement, and one of them is shown in a painting
(<a href="#fig016">Fig. 16</a>). No private houses opened on this area; it was
wholly given up to the public life of the city and was surrounded
by temples, markets, and buildings devoted to the
civic administration.</p>

<p>The colonnade was not uniform in character upon all the
three sides. As will be seen from our plan (<a href="#plan2">Plan II</a>), on the
south side, and on the adjoining portion of the east side as far
as Abbondanza Street, it was constructed with two rows of columns
and had a double depth. On the east side, north of this
street, the porticos in front of four successive buildings (K, L,
M, N) took its place. For the greater part of its extent the colonnade
was built in two stories, the lower of the Doric, the upper
of the Ionic order. The upper gallery was made accessible by
three stairways, at the southeast and southwest corners of the
Forum and at the middle of the west side; on the east side it
did not extend beyond Abbondanza Street.</p>

<p>The portico in front of the first of the four buildings referred
to, that of Eumachia, contained a double series of columns, one
above the other, corresponding in style and dimensions with
those of the colonnade; but there was no upper floor running
back from the intervening entablature. The arrangement in
front of the fourth building, the Macellum, was similar; as the
remains of the porticos in front of the two intervening buildings
have wholly disappeared, it is impossible to determine their
character.</p>

<p>The area of the Forum was paved with rectangular flags of
whitish limestone. In front of the colonnade, the pavement of
which was about twenty inches above that of the open space,
a broad step or ledge projected, covering a gutter for rain
water; the water found its way into the gutter through semicircular
openings in the outer edge of the step.</p>

<p>Of the many statues that once adorned the Forum not
one has been found. As may be seen from the pedestals
still in place, they were of three kinds, and varied greatly in
size.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>First, statues of citizens who had rendered distinguished
services were placed in front of the colonnade on the ledge
over the gutter. Four pedestals that once supported statues
of this sort may be seen on the west side.</p>

<p>Then equestrian statues of life size were set up in front of the
ledge, these also in honor of dignitaries of the city (<a href="#fig017">Fig. 17</a>).
On one of the pedestals the veneering of colored marble is
still preserved, with an inscription showing that the person
represented was Quintus Sallustius, "Duumvir, Quinquennial
Duumvir, Patron of the Colony."</p>

<p>Finally, on the south side, the life size equestrian statues,
which seem at the outset to have been arranged symmetrically,
were almost all removed in order to make room for four much
larger statues, the pedestals of which still remain (<a href="#fig053">Fig. 53</a>, p.
122). These must have represented emperors, or members of
the imperial families. The pedestal in the middle, which is in
the form of an arch almost square at the base, is much the
oldest. Upon it was probably placed a colossal statue of
Augustus. It is incredible that during the long and successful
reign of the first emperor no statue in his honor should
have been erected in Pompeii; and this is the most suitable
place. The other three pedestals are similar in construction,
and clearly belong together. The one at the right (2 on the
plan) supported a colossal equestrian statue; that at the left (3)
a colossal standing figure; on the third, further forward (4),
was a smaller equestrian statue. Here stood, then, emperor,
empress, and crown prince&mdash;Claudius, Agrippina, Nero.</p>

<p>A fifth pedestal, for an equestrian statue of the same size as
that of Nero, is seen further to the north, in front of the temple
of Jupiter (5). While unquestionably later than the time of
Augustus, it must on the other hand be older than the pedestals
of members of the Claudian family; for aside from himself, no
one belonging to Nero's time can be taken into consideration,
and after his death the Forum lay in ruins in consequence of
the earthquake of the year 63. Who stood here, however, can
scarcely be even conjectured. Not necessarily an emperor; the
younger Drusus, for instance, Tiberius's son, or Germanicus
might have been thus honored if they had in any way come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
into relation with the Pompeians. But if an emperor, it must
have been Caligula; another place was provided for the statue
of Tiberius.</p>

<p>In the south side of the arch at the northeast corner of the
Forum are two niches. It is highly probable that statues of
the two oldest sons of Germanicus, Nero and Drusus, were
placed in them; a fragment of an inscription referring to the
former was found near by. These became presumptive heirs
to the throne after the death of Tiberius's son Drusus, in 23
<span class="s08">A.D.</span>; but both afterwards fell victims to the morbid suspicions
of the emperor and the plots of Sejanus, Nero in 29 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>,
Drusus four years later.</p>

<p>On the top of the arch an equestrian statue of Tiberius probably
stood. That such a statue was placed here seems clear
from analogy. North of this arch was another, almost in line
with it, at the end of Mercury Street where it opens into Nola
Street; and here the excavators found fragments of a bronze
equestrian statue which were put together and set up in the
Naples Museum. Whether this statue represented Caligula or
Nero has been a matter of dispute, but the former is really
excluded from consideration by the short, heavy figure, which is
better suited to Nero. There is no decided resemblance to
Nero either; but it is quite possible that, although as crown
prince he had been honored with a statue in the Forum, the
Pompeians thought it best to erect for him as emperor a more
imposing monument.</p>

<p>Before leaving the area we may raise the question whether it
contained a speakers' platform, like the Rostra in the Roman
Forum. If we have reference to a special structure, probably
not; no trace of a separate tribunal has been discovered. The
orator who wished to address the people, however, could mount
the broad platform in front of the temple of Jupiter, on which
once an altar stood; before him the audience could gather in
the open, on the only side of the Forum free from the colonnade.
This place well suited the convenience of both speaker
and hearers. It is possible that we should also identify as a
tribune the platform in a recess at the southeast corner <a href="#Page_120">(p. 120</a>).</p>

<p>On even a cursory inspection the Forum is seen to lack unity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
in the details of its plan and in its architecture; the fact soon
becomes apparent that it reached its final form only as the
result of a long period of development. It will be worth while
briefly to trace this development, and to note at least the more
important changes which followed one another in the course of
the centuries.</p>

<p>In the earliest times the Forum was merely an open square
bounded by four streets.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig013" id="fig013"></a>
<img src="images/fig013.jpg" width="489" height="292" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 13.&mdash;North end of the Forum, with the Temple of Jupiter, restored.</p>
</div>
<p>The proof that this was the original form is in part based
upon the orientation of the temple of Apollo. The sides of
this temple have the same direction as the north and south
streets in the northern part of the city, and must have been
laid out parallel with a street that once ran between it and
the Forum. The temple is, therefore, older than the colonnade
of the Forum, which shows a marked deviation from the
line of its axis; the divergence, as may be seen on our plan,
was in part concealed by making a difference in the thickness
of the pillars between the court of the temple and the Forum.
It is obvious that the colonnade on the west side takes the place
of an older street; the south side was probably defined by the
prolongation of Abbondanza Street toward the southwest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>Near the southeast corner an inscription was found: <i>V[ibius]
Popidius Ep[idii] f[ilius] q[uaestor] porticus faciendas coeravit</i>,
'Vibius Popidius, the son of Epidius, when quaestor caused this
colonnade to be erected.' No clew to the date is given, but it
must have been before the coming of the Roman colony, for
after that time there was no office of quaestor in Pompeii. It
must also have been before the Social War; in those years of
tumult an extensive colonnade would not have been built, and
when the national spirit was so vehemently asserting itself, we
should expect to find inscriptions upon public works in the
Oscan language, certainly not in Latin. But the use of Latin
may very well date from the latter part of the period of alliance
with Rome; we may then with much probability assign the inscription
to the second half of the second century <span class="s08">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Remains of the colonnade of Popidius are still to be seen on
the south side, and on the adjoining part of the east side, extending
just across Abbondanza Street; traces of it are found
also on the west side, where it was afterward replaced by a new
structure. On the east side north of Abbondanza Street no traces
remain; the appearance of this part of the Forum was entirely
changed when the four buildings (K, L, M, N) with their porticos
were erected, but we can hardly doubt that the original
colonnade extended here also. Our illustration (<a href="#fig014">Fig. 14</a>) shows
the arrangement of the Doric columns in the lower story; of
the Ionic columns above only scanty fragments have been
recovered. The appearance of the whole may be suggested by
our restoration (<a href="#fig013">Fig. 13</a>).</p>

<p>In style and construction this colonnade belongs to the Tufa
Period (<a href="#Page_40">p. 40</a>). While the forms are not those of the classical
period, they nevertheless manifest Greek feeling. The low ratio
in the proportions of the Doric columns, of which the height is
equal to five diameters, well accords with their use as a support
for an upper gallery; elsewhere in pre-Roman Pompeii more
slender proportions are preferred, even for the Doric style.
The shaft is well shaped, with a moderate swelling (<i>entasis</i>).
Only the upper part is fluted; as the sharp edges of the flutings
near the bottom might easily be marred, the divisions of the surface
on the lower third of the shaft were left flat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>The architrave is relatively low, the result of an interesting
peculiarity in the method of construction. Blocks of tufa long
enough to span the intercolumniations were too weak to sustain
the weight of the rest of the entablature. To meet this difficulty
a line of thick planks was placed in old Italic fashion above
the capitals of the columns, and on these were laid short tufa
blocks. Thus in our illustration (<a href="#fig014">Fig. 14</a>), while the upper of
the two bands of the architrave is seen to be of stone, the lower
shows the modern timber supplied in the place of the ancient.
That the planks were in reality no thicker than has been
assumed in the reconstruction is proved beyond question by the
later colonnade on the west side, which, although entirely of
stone, corresponds throughout in its proportions with the older
one; the architrave is equally narrow, and is likewise divided
into two parts.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig014" id="fig014"></a>
<img src="images/fig014.jpg" width="368" height="343" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 14.&mdash;Remnant of the colonnade of Popidius, at the south end of the Forum.</p>
</div>
<p>This explanation is curiously confirmed by an architectural
painting on the garden wall of one of the finest houses of the
Tufa Period, the house of the Faun. Here we find pilasters
and entablature, except the architrave, painted white; but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
architrave is painted in two bands, of which the lower is yellow,
as if to represent wood. Nothing would have been easier than to
leave the architrave, moulded in stucco, of one color as if it were
all of one material; but special effort was made apparently to
indicate the appearance of a lower division of timber. From
this we may infer that in actual construction no pains was taken
to conceal the lack of uniformity in structural materials by laying
a coat of white or colored stucco over wood and stone alike;
on the contrary, the difference was not only recognized in the
decoration, but even accentuated, as the timber, whether retaining
its original color or painted with a suitable tint, presented a
marked contrast with the stone the surface of which was covered
with white stucco. If the strip of timber in the architrave
had been perceptibly thicker than that of stone above it, the
effect would not have been good; as the earlier Greek polychrome
decoration was now no longer in vogue, the stripe of
color above the capitals made a pleasing variation from the
prevailing whiteness of the structure.</p>

<p>The Basilica at the southwest corner and the temple of
Jupiter both conform to the same variation from the direction
of the early north and south street that we have noticed in the
case of the colonnade of Popidius; they belong, therefore, to
the same remodelling of the Forum. It is quite possible that
the erection of the temple, by limiting the area of the Forum
on the north side, caused its extension toward the south
beyond the earlier boundary. Originally the temple was isolated,
the north end of the Forum on either side being left
open; later, but still in the time of the Republic, a high
boundary wall with passageways was built on both sides of it.
Later still the two arches were erected in a line with its façade;
afterwards, in the time of Tiberius, the wall at the right of
the temple was replaced by the commemorative arch (I), and
the smaller arch near the façade at the right was removed
in order that there might be an unimpeded view of the great
arch from the area.</p>

<p>The colonnade of Popidius may have stood for more than
a century; the necessity of making thoroughgoing repairs no
doubt became urgent. In the meantime, however, the taste of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
the Pompeians had undergone a change, and instead of repairing
the old colonnade they began to replace it by a new one,
a part of which is shown in <a href="#fig015">Fig. 15</a>. Better material, the
whitish limestone, was used, and the construction was more
substantial; the blocks of the entablature were fitted together
so as to form a flat arch. Though the new colonnade followed
closely the proportions of the old, effective details, such as the
fluting of the columns, and the triglyphs with the guttae underneath,
were omitted. The refined sense of form characteristic
of the earlier time was no longer manifest; all is coarse and inartistic,
the swelling on the shafts of the columns, for example,
being carried too high.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig015" id="fig015"></a>
<img src="images/fig015.jpg" width="366" height="354" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 15.&mdash;Part of the new colonnade, near the southwest corner of the Forum.</p>
</div>
<p>The new colonnade had a second story of the Ionic order, of
the columns of which (though not of the entablature) considerable
fragments have been found. The stylobate on which the
columns rested was renewed in limestone, and about the same
time the Forum was paved and the ledge over the gutter was
laid with flags of the same material.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<p>This second remodelling of the Forum commenced in the
early years of the Empire, the pavement having been laid
before the pedestal of the monument to Augustus was built.
It was never carried to completion. On the west side the
new colonnade was almost finished when the earthquake of
the year 63 threw it nearly all down. At the time of the
eruption only the columns at the south end of this side, which
had safely passed through the earthquake, were still standing
with their entablature; they are shown in <a href="#fig015">Fig. 15</a>. The
area was then strewn with blocks, which the stonecutters were
engaged in making ready for the rebuilding.</p>

<p>The Forum of Pompeii, as of other ancient cities, was first
of all a market place. Early in the morning the country folk
gathered here with the products of the farm; here all day long
tradespeople of every sort exhibited their wares. In later
times the pressure of business led to the erection of separate
buildings around the Forum to relieve the congestion; such
were the Macellum, used as a provision market; the Eumachia
building, erected to accommodate the clothing trade; the Basilica
and the market house west of the temple of Jupiter, devoted
to other branches of trade. Yet in a literal sense the Forum
always remained the business centre of the city.</p>

<p>It served, too, as the favorite promenade and lounging place,
where men met to discuss matters of mutual interest, or to
indulge in gossip. Here idlers loitered and plied busier men
with questions regarding public affairs, makers and dealers
came together to talk over and settle points of difference, and
young people pursued their romantic adventures. He can best
form an idea of this bustling, ceaseless, varied activity who
knows what the piazza means in the life of a modern Italian
city, and stops to consider how much has been taken from the
life of the piazza by the cafés and similar places of resort;
modern squares, moreover, are usually not provided, as were the
ancient, with inviting colonnades, affording protection against
both sun and rain.</p>

<p>The life of the Forum seemed so interesting to one of the
citizens of Pompeii that he devoted to the portrayal of it
a series of paintings on the walls of a room. The pictures are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
light and sketchy, but they give a vivid representation of
ancient life in a small city. First, in front of the equestrian
statues near the colonnade we see dealers of every kind and
description. There sits a seller of copper vessels and iron
utensils (<a href="#fig016">Fig. 16</a>), so lost in thought that a friend is calling
his attention to a possible purchaser who is just coming up.
Next come two shoemakers, one waiting on women, another
on men; then two cloth dealers. Further on a man is selling
portions of warm food from a kettle; then we see a woman
with fruit and vegetables, and a man selling bread. Another
dealer in utensils is engaged in eager bargaining, while his son,
squatting on the ground, mends a pot.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig016" id="fig016"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 16.&mdash;Scene in the Forum.<br />
In the foreground, at the left, dealer in utensils; at the right, shoemaker waiting on four
ladies. Wall painting.</p>
</div>
<p>The scenes now change. A man sitting with a writing tablet
and stylus listens closely to the words of another who stands
near by; he reminds us of the scribes who, under the portico of
the theatre of San Carlo, at Naples, write letters for those that
have been denied the privilege of an education.</p>

<p>Then come men wearing tunics, engaged in some transaction,
in the course of which they seem to pass judgment on the contents
of bottles which they hold in their hands; their business
perhaps involves the testing of wine. Beyond these, some men
are taking a walk; a woman is giving alms to a beggar; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
two children play hide and seek around a column. The following
scene is not easy to understand, but apparently has reference
to some legal process; a woman leads a little girl with a small
tablet before her
breast into the presence
of two seated
men who wear the
toga.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 346px;"><a name="fig017" id="fig017"></a>
<img src="images/fig017.jpg" width="346" height="441" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 17.&mdash;Scene in the Forum.<br />
Citizens reading a public notice. Wall painting.</p>
</div>

<p>In the next scene
(<a href="#fig017">Fig. 17</a>) four men
are reading a notice
posted on a long
board, which is fastened
to the pedestals
of three equestrian
statues. The
sketchy character of
the painting is especially
obvious in the
representations of
the horses, which
are nevertheless lifelike.
It is also interesting
to note that
the heads of the men
in these scenes are
uncovered; in stormy weather pointed hoods (shown in a tavern
scene, <a href="#fig234">Fig. 234</a>) were sometimes worn. The festoons suggest a
trimming of the colonnade for some festal occasion.</p>

<p>The last scene is from school life. A pupil is to receive
a flogging. He is mounted on the back of one of his schoolmates,
while another holds him by the legs; a slave is about
to lay on the lash, and the teacher stands near by with an air
of composure. It would not be safe to infer from this, however,
that there was a school in the Forum; the columns in
this scene are different from those in the others and are further
apart. Possibly a part of the small portico north of the court
of the temple of Apollo was at one time let to a schoolmaster.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<p>The most important religious festivals were celebrated in the
Forum. Here naturally festal honors were paid to the highest
of the gods&mdash;the whole area enclosed by the colonnade was
the court of his temple; but we learn from an inscription, mentioned
below, that celebrations were held here in honor of
Apollo also, whose temple adjoined the Forum, and was at first
even more closely connected with it than in later times.</p>

<p>Vitruvius informs us that in Greek towns the market place,
<i>agora</i>, was laid out in the form of a square (a statement which
is not confirmed by modern excavations), but that in the cities
of Italy, on account of the gladiatorial combats, the Forum
should have an oblong shape, the breadth being two thirds of
the length. The purpose in giving a lengthened form to the
Forum, as also to the Amphitheatre, was no doubt to secure,
at the middle of the sides, a greater number of good seats,
from which a spectacle could be witnessed. In the Pompeian
Forum, as may be seen from the dimensions given at the
beginning of this chapter, the breadth is less than one third
of the length. However, there can be little doubt that gladiatorial
exhibitions were frequently held there before the building
of the Amphitheatre, which dates from the earlier years
of the Roman colony. After this time the Forum was still
used for games and contests of a less dangerous character.
The epitaph of a certain A. Clodius Flaccus, which is now lost,
but was copied by a scholar in the seventeenth century, tells us
at length how in his first, and again in his second, duumvirate
(he was duumvir for the third time in 3 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>), in connection with
the festival of Apollo, he not only gave gladiatorial exhibitions
in the Amphitheatre, but also provided bullfights and other
spectacles, as well as musical entertainments and pantomimes,
in the Forum.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Forum as a place for gladiatorial combats,
Vitruvius adds that the spaces between the columns should
be wide,&mdash;that the view of spectators might be as little as
possible impeded,&mdash;and that the upper story of the colonnade
should be arranged with reference to the collection of an admission
fee. The latter suggestion is of special interest. As we
know from other sources, at public games certain places were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
reserved for the officials and for the friends of him who gave
the spectacle; others were free to the public, while for still
others an admission fee was charged. If the exhibition was
held in a market place, with lower and upper colonnades, the
former would be open to the people; the latter in part reserved,
in part accessible on payment of the price of admission.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to know whether on such occasions at
Pompeii the gates of the Forum itself were shut, so that admission
even to the free space could be regulated; perhaps they
were in earlier times when, as at Rome, slaves were forbidden
to witness the games. However, Cicero speaks of this time-honored
regulation as in his day already a thing of the past;
and so in Roman Pompeii the gates of the Forum may have
remained open even on the days of the games. Their most
important use was probably in connection with the voting.</p>

<p>The Forum had a part also in spectacles which were not
presented there. We are safe in assuming that, at least in the
earlier times, whenever a gladiatorial combat was given in the
Amphitheatre, or a play in the Theatre, the city officials, including
especially the official providing the entertainment, formed
in procession with their retinue and proceeded in festal attire
to the place of amusement. These processions could scarcely
have formed anywhere else than in the Forum, and thence they
must have started out.</p>

<p>The fact that the Forum was not accessible for vehicles suggests
a significant point of difference between the festal processions
of the colony and those of the capital. In the latter,
vehicles had a prominent place. Thus at Rome the official who
gave the games in the Circus entered the edifice with his retinue
in chariots in the imposing circus parade, <i>pompa circensis</i>, and a
similar usage prevailed in the case of other processions; priests,
too, and priestesses were on many occasions allowed to ride.
But even in Rome carriages were always considered a matter
of luxury; and the municipal regulations promulgated by
Caesar prohibited the use of vehicles, except those required
for religious and civic processions, on the streets of the city
from sunrise till the tenth hour, that is, till four o'clock in the
afternoon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<p>In Pompeii, and without doubt also in other cities of Italy
and the provinces, the closing of the Forum to vehicles made
it necessary that religious and other processions should proceed
on foot. We have no evidence of any exception to this rule.
We ought perhaps to recognize in it one of those devices by
means of which Rome maintained a position of dignified superiority
over the provincial towns; to her processions was allowed
an element of display which to theirs was denied. It was not
permitted to name the two chief executive officers of a municipality
consuls, though their functions, within limits, corresponded
with those of the consuls at Rome; nor could the city council
be called a senate, though the Roman writers did not hesitate
to apply this term to corresponding bodies in states and cities
outside of Rome's jurisdiction. For like reasons, it would seem
that on public occasions officials and priests of a provincial
town were not permitted, as were those in Rome, to ride. Was
this humiliating restriction laid upon the Pompeians when the
Roman colony came, or previously when the city was in name
the ally of Rome, but in reality already subject? The evidence
is almost conclusive for the latter alternative; for the colonnade
of Popidius, which as we have seen was erected in the period
of autonomy, left no entrance for vehicles, though in other
ways it added greatly to the attractiveness and convenience of
the Forum as a place for civic and religious celebrations.</p>

<p>No record of events has survived to help us form a picture
of the Forum as the seat of deliberative and judicial functions,
the centre of the city's political life; yet stirring scenes present
themselves to the imagination as we recall the critical periods
in the history of the city.</p>

<p>In the Forum, about 400 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, the valiant Samnite mountaineers,
having taken the city by storm, assembled and established
their civic organization; here, in later times, without
doubt amid conflicts similar to those at Rome, the polity was
put to the test and underwent transformation. Fierce enough
the strifes may have been during the Samnite wars, and again
in the time of Hannibal,&mdash;after the battle of Cannae,&mdash;when
the aristocrats who favored Rome contended with the national
party for the mastery. Here, on the platform in front of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
temple of Jupiter, the leaders of the national party stood in
90 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, and with flaming words roused the people to revolt, to
join the movement which, starting in Asculum, had spread like
wildfire over Southern Italy.</p>

<p>Then ten years of bloody war,&mdash;siege, campaigns, surrender,&mdash;and
again the scene changes. Roman soldiers stand thick
in serried ranks upon the area. They are the veterans of
Sulla. An officer bearing a civil commission, the nephew of
the Dictator, appears before them. Standing in front of the
temple of Jupiter, he makes a proclamation regarding the founding
and administration of the colony. The citizens crowd back
timidly into the colonnade. Many of the best of the Pompeians
have fallen in battle; of the rest, a part at least will be dispossessed
of house and home to make room for the intruders,
whose arrogance they will be compelled submissively to endure.</p>

<p>This is the last tragic act in the Pompeian Forum. After
this time, there will be disputes regarding the rights of the old
residents and the colonists, public questions of many kinds will
call for settlement; the elections will come each year, and the
ardent southern temperament may assert itself in violent
scenes. Yet all these disturbances will be only as the ripples
on the surface; the depths will remain undisturbed. The life
of Pompeii has become an integral part of the life of the Roman
world.

<h3>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="s08"><i>GENERAL VIEW OF THE BUILDINGS ABOUT THE FORUM&mdash;THE
TEMPLE OF JUPITER</i></span></h3>

<p>The Forum was to the ancient city what the atrium was to
the early Italic house; it was used for every purpose for which
a special place was not provided elsewhere. And as sleeping
rooms, dining rooms, and storerooms were grouped about the
atrium and opened into it, so around the Forum lay the edifices
which served the requirements of the public life,&mdash;the most
important temples, the municipal buildings, and market houses
or exchanges for different branches of business.</p>

<p>Three temples adjoined the Forum at Pompeii. In addition,
there was a sanctuary of the City Lares; and the temples of
Venus Pompeiana and Fortuna Augusta were but a short distance
away. These religious edifices are representative of the
different periods in the history of the city.</p>

<p>In very early times the Oscans of Pompeii received from
the Greeks who had settled on the coast the cult of Apollo,
and built for the Hellenic god a large, fine temple (C, in <a href="#plan2">Plan
II</a>) adjoining the Forum on the west side.</p>

<p>Several centuries later, the divinities of the Capitol&mdash;Jupiter,
Juno, and Minerva&mdash;were enthroned in the temple that on the
north side towered above the area (H).</p>

<p>On the east or right side followed, in Roman times, the
edifices erected for the worship of the emperors. The oldest
is the unroofed building, with a broad, open front, dedicated
to the Lares of the City and to the Genius of Augustus (L).
Further north, in the first block at the right beyond the Forum,
is the temple of Fortuna Augusta, the goddess who guarded

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
(K, 5); this seems to have sufficed also for the worship of
Nero. After Nero's death and after the brief Civil War,
a temple (M) was built close to the shrine of the Lares in
honor of Vespasian, the restorer of peace, the new Augustus.
This was the last temple erected in Pompeii; it was not entirely
finished at the time of the eruption.</p>

<p>Three buildings at the south end of the Forum were used
for city offices (P-R). They were much alike, each containing
a single large hall. They were seemingly built in the early
years of the Empire, and repaired after the earthquake of the
year 63. There is also a structure at the southeast corner,
south of Abbondanza Street, which we may identify as the
voting place, the Comitium (O). At the northwest corner
was apparently the city treasury, built in the latest years of
Pompeii, perhaps on the site of an earlier structure of the
same kind (F).</p>

<p>At a comparatively early period the area was found to be
too small for the increasing volume of business; and the
demand for roofed space made itself felt. In the second
century <span class="s08">B.C.</span> the large and splendid Basilica (B), serving the
double purpose of a court and an exchange, was built at the
southwest corner.</p>

<p>Diagonally opposite, near the temple of Jupiter, a provision
market, the Macellum (K), was constructed; this also at an
early date. It was entirely rebuilt in the time of the Empire,
perhaps in the reign of Claudius. Previous to this rebuilding,
the priestess Eumachia had erected an exchange for the fullers
on the same side of the Forum, further south (N).</p>

<p>On the west side, from pre-Roman times, stood a small
colonnade in two stories, with its rear against the rear of
the colonnade on the north side of the court of the temple of
Apollo; only the first story, of the Doric order, has been preserved.
Probably this structure and the small open space in
front were at first used as a market; later, in the imperial
period, shops (D') were built upon the open space, and the
colonnade was made over into closed rooms, the purpose of
which, except in the case of one, is unknown (6, 7, 7). In the
last years of the city, a large market building (D) was erected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
between this small place and the Forum. It was connected
both with the city treasury and with a latrina.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2">The temple of Jupiter dominates the Forum, and more than
any other structure gives it character. As we have seen, its
orientation accords with that of the colonnade of Popidius. It
probably dates from the pre-Roman period, the columns being
of tufa covered with white stucco. The earthquake of the year
63 left the temple in ruins, and at the time of the eruption the
work of rebuilding had not yet commenced. In the meantime,
it was used as a workshop for stonecutters. The journal of
the excavations reports the finding here of the torso of a colossal
statue out of which a smaller statue was being carved. A
place for the worship of the divinities of the temple must temporarily
have been provided elsewhere.</p>

<p>The temple stands on a podium 10 Roman feet high, and
including the steps, 125 Roman feet long (<a href="#fig018">Fig. 18</a>). Very
nearly a half of the whole length is given
to the cella; of the other half, a little
more than two thirds is occupied by the portico,
leaving about a third (20 Roman feet)
for the steps. The pediment was sustained by
six Corinthian columns about 28 feet high.
This arrangement&mdash;a deep portico in front
of the cella&mdash;is Etruscan, though the canon
of Vitruvius, that in Etruscan temples the
depth of the portico should equal that of the
cella, is violated. The high podium also,
with steps in front, is characteristic of Etruscan,
or at least of early Italic religious architecture. On the
other hand, the architectural forms of the superstructure are
Greek, and these in turn have had their influence upon the
plan; the intercolumniations are not wide, as in the Tuscan
style with its wooden architrave, but narrower, as in the Greek
orders. Vitruvius speaks of temples such as this, in which
Greek and Etruscan elements are united, at the end of his
directions for the building of temples; they are a development
of Roman architecture.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<p>The arrangement of the steps is peculiar. Above is a series
of long steps reaching nearly across the front (<a href="#fig019">Fig. 19</a>); below
are two narrow flights near the sides, and between them is the
projecting front of the podium, used as a tribune, which has
already been mentioned (<a href="#Page_48">p. 48</a>).</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 19.&mdash;Ruins of the temple of Jupiter.</p>
</div>

<p>That an altar stood at the middle of this platform is proved
by a relief with a representation of the north side of the
Forum, found on the base of a chapel of the Lares in the
house of the wealthy Pompeian, L. Caecilius Jucundus. At
the left we see the arch near the façade and a strip of wall
connecting it with the temple; next a corner of the platform
with an equestrian statue; then a flight of steps, and the
front of the platform with an altar at the middle; finally the
other flight of steps and another equestrian statue in a position
corresponding with that of the first. The columns shown
in the relief do not agree in number or style with those of the
façade of the temple, but such inaccuracies are common in
ancient representations of buildings, and there can be no doubt
that the temple of Jupiter is represented; the relief has, in
fact, been used in making our restoration of the arch at the left
(<a href="#fig013">Fig. 13</a>).</p>

<p>Both the portico and the cella no doubt had a coffered ceiling.
Just in front of the doorway, which was fifteen Roman
feet wide, are the large stones with holes for the pivots on
which the massive double doors swung (indicated in <a href="#fig018">Fig. 18</a>); the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
doors here were not placed in the doorway, but in front of it,
and were besides somewhat larger, so that the effect was rendered
more imposing when they were shut.</p>

<p>The ornamentation of the cella was especially rich. A row of
Ionic columns, about fifteen feet high, stood in front of each of
the longer sides; the entablature above them probably served as
a base for a similar row of Corinthian columns, the entablature
of which in turn supported the ceiling. On the intermediate
entablature, between the columns of the upper series, statues and
votive offerings were doubtless placed. The floor about the sides
was covered with white mosaic, of which scanty remains have
been found; the marble pavement
of the centre (inside of the dotted line,
<a href="#fig018">Fig. 18</a>) has wholly disappeared.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 198px;"><a name="fig020" id="fig020"></a>
<img src="images/fig020.jpg" width="198" height="409" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 20.&mdash;Section of the wall
decoration in the cella of the
temple of Jupiter.</p>
</div>

<p>A section of the wall decoration, in
the second Pompeian style, is shown
in <a href="#fig020">Fig. 20</a>. We notice here the characteristic
elements&mdash;imitation of marble
veneering, with large red central
panels and a cornice above. The base
with its simple dividing lines upon a
black ground was painted over in the
third style; originally it must have
been more suggestive of real construction,
with a narrow painted border
along the upper edge.</p>

<p>Against the rear wall of the cella
stands a large pedestal, three times
as long as it is broad. It was originally
divided by four pilasters&mdash;two
at the corners and two on the front
between them&mdash;into three parts.
Later the pilasters and the entablature
over them were removed, and the
whole was covered with marble veneering. Inside were three
small rooms, entered by separate doors from the cella. The
pedestal was thus built for three images; three divinities were
worshipped here, and in the little chambers underneath were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
perhaps kept the trappings with which on festal occasions the
images were decked.</p>

<p>A head of Jupiter, of which we shall speak later, was found
in the cella, as was also an inscription of the year 37 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>, containing
a dedication to Jupiter Optimus Maximus, the ruling deity
of the Capitol at Rome. It is thus proved beyond question that
the Capitoline Jupiter was worshipped here; and it will not be
difficult to ascertain what other divinities shared with him the
honors of the temple.</p>

<p>As the Roman colonies strove in all things to be Rome in
miniature, each thought it necessary to have a Capitolium&mdash;a
temple for the worship of the gods of the Roman Capitol, Jupiter,
Juno, and Minerva; and this naturally became the most
important temple in the city. That the worship of the three
divinities was established at Pompeii is evident from the discovery
of three images representing them, in the little temple conjecturally
assigned to Zeus Milichius. These are poor images
of terra cotta, and the temple itself was altogether unworthy to
be a place of worship for the great gods that shaped the destinies
of Rome. We are warranted in the conclusion that the
temple of Zeus Milichius was used temporarily for the worship
of the three divinities of the large temple till the latter could be
rebuilt; and that Juno and Minerva stood on the great pedestal
beside the king of the gods.</p>

<p>It seems strange that the Pompeians should have erected a
temple to the gods of the Capitol in the pre-Roman period. It
must be remembered, however, that the worship of the three
divinities was by no means limited to Rome and her colonies.
The Etruscans, as Servius informs us in his commentary on
Virgil, thought that a city was not properly founded unless it
contained sanctuaries of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva. Vitruvius,
also, in his directions for laying out a city, makes the general
statement that the most prominent site should be set aside for the
temples of the same divinities. If we consider further that
the opposition of the Italians to Rome found expression only in
the Social War, and that previously they had looked upon the
attainment of Roman citizenship as the highest object of ambition,
the gradual adoption of Roman customs at Pompeii and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
the erection of a temple to the Capitoline divinities are seen
to be less remarkable. The building of such a temple was a
natural expression of political aspirations; it was in complete
harmony with the use of Latin in the inscription of Popidius
(<a href="#Page_50">p. 50</a>).</p>

<p>There is, however, another possibility that may be stated.
The remodelling of the Forum was certainly commenced in the
pre-Roman period; but it is not impossible that the work was
interrupted by the breaking out of the Social War and that the
colonists completed it, dedicating the temple to the gods of the
Capitol. The use of several brick-shaped blocks of stone,&mdash;such
blocks are not found in other buildings of the pre-Roman
time,&mdash;the lack of any trace of the wall decoration of the first
style, the form of the egg-and-dart moulding on the capitals of
the Ionic columns in the cella, and the correspondence of certain
dimensions with the Roman scale of measurements may be
alleged in favor of this hypothesis. The evidence at present
does not warrant a positive decision against it.</p>

<p>The fact that we have here a Capitolium may explain the
special prominence of the altar in front, which might just as
well have been placed in the area of the Forum at the foot of
the steps. In Rome the Capitol lay upon a summit of a hill;
perhaps the aim in this case was to place not only the temple
but also the altar upon an elevation so that here, as there, the
priest should go up to offer sacrifice.</p>

<p>The podium of the temple contains vaulted rooms which can
be entered from the Forum through a narrow door on the east
side. Their use is unknown. We are reminded of the temple
of Saturn in the Forum at Rome, the podium of which served
as a treasury, <i>aerarium</i>. The vaults, <i>favissae</i>, may have been
used as a place of safe keeping for treasure, or for furniture of
the temple, or for discarded votive offerings.</p>

Museum. After Tafel 130 of the Brunn-Bruckmann
Denkmaeler.</p>
</div>

<p>The beautiful head of Jupiter found in the cella deserves more
than a passing mention. In order to appreciate its character
we may view it in contrast with the Otricoli Zeus, with which
it is closely related. In both heads we feel the lack of that
majestic simplicity, that ineffable and godlike calm, which rested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
on the features of the Zeus of Phidias. Here man has much
more obviously made God in his own image; the face shows
less of the ideal, with more of human energy and passion.</p>

<p>It is not for us to decide whether the Otricoli mask is from the
school of Praxiteles, or shows more of the influence of Lysippus;
it is sufficient here to notice that the type was developed in the
second half of the
fourth century <span class="s08">B.C.</span>,
the century after Phidias.
The similarity
between these two examples
of the type
is apparent at first
glance. The shape of
the two heads is, in
general, the same, and
there is the same profusion
of hair and
beard, symbolic of
power; but the differences
in detail are
striking.</p>

<p>In the Otricoli Zeus
the peculiar shape of
the forehead&mdash;prominent
in the middle up
to the roots of the hair
and retreating at the
sides&mdash;seems to suggest,
not so much the
power of a world-encompassing and lofty intellect, as absorption
in great, unfathomable thoughts. In the lines of the
massive face irresistible force of will is revealed, and the capability
of fierce passion lurks beneath the projecting lower part of
the forehead and uneven eyebrows, threatening like a thundercloud.
But for the moment all is deep repose, and the lids seem
partly closed over eyes that look downwards, as if not concerned
with seeing. The sculptor has conceived of Zeus as the occult
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
power of nature, alike the origin and law of all things, or as the
personification of the heavens veiled by impenetrable mists.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 324px;"><a name="fig022" id="fig022"></a>
<img src="images/fig022.jpg" width="324" height="436" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 22.&mdash;Bust of Jupiter found at Pompeii.<br />
Naples Museum.</p>
</div>

<p>Great force of will is seen also in the face of the Pompeian
god; but it is will dominated by alert and all-embracing mind.
The forehead expands in a broad arch; the eyes, wide open,
look out with full vision under sharply cut brows. Here we
have no secret brooding;
a powerful yet
clearly defined and
comprehensible personality
is stamped
upon features carved
in bold, free lines.
And this personality
is not lost in mystical
self-contemplation;
the god is following
with closest attention
the course of events
in some far distant
place, affairs that in
the next moment may
require his intervention;
excitement and
expectancy are seen
in the raised upper
lip. The ideal of this
artist was the wise
and powerful king,
whose watchful and all-protecting eye sees to the furthest limits
of his kingdom. Surely this variation of the Otricoli type must
have been conceived in a monarchical period, the period when
the Greek world was ruled by the successors of Alexander.</p>

<p>The Pompeian god is more a sovereign; the Zeus of Otricoli
is more poetic, more divine.

<h3>CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE BASILICA</i></span></h3>

<p>The Basilica, at the southwest corner of the Forum, was the
most magnificent and architecturally the most interesting building
at Pompeii. Its construction and decoration point to the
pre-Roman time; and there is also an inscription scratched on
the stucco of the wall, dating from almost the beginning of the
Roman colony: <i>C. Pumidius Dipilus heic fuit a. d. v. nonas
Octobreis M. Lepid. Q. Catul. cos.</i>,&mdash;'C. Pumidius Dipilus was
here on the fifth day before the nones of October in the consulship
of Marcus Lepidus and Quintus Catulus,' that is October
3, 78 <span class="s08">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The purpose of the building is clearly indicated not only by
its plan and the details of its arrangement but also by the word
<i>Bassilica</i> scratched a number of times by idlers on the stucco of
the outer wall at the right of the south entrance. This sure
identification lends to the edifice a special significance; it is without
doubt the oldest example that we have of an important
architectural type whose origin is lost in obscurity, but of which
the derivative forms may still be recognized in the architecture of
to-day. What the temple developed by the Greeks was to pagan
antiquity, that the basilica became to the Christian Church&mdash;a
type dominating a system of religious architecture. Pagan
worship was individual,&mdash;a narrow chamber sufficed for the
image of the god and the requirements of religious service; but
Christian worship was social, and its functions demanded a
larger room, in which a congregation could be assembled.
The religious architecture of the Church therefore broke with
the religious architecture of pagan antiquity, and turned for its
model to the basilica.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of the history of the basilica begins with the
erection of the Basilica Porcia in Rome by Cato the Elder, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
184 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>; other basilicas followed, and in Caesar's day a number
stood about the Forum. Regarding its development prior to
the time of Cato only conjectures can be offered. The name
<i>basilica</i> (<i>basilike stoa</i>, 'the royal hall') points to a Greek
origin; we should naturally look for the prototype of the Roman
as well as the Pompeian structure in the capitals of the Alexandrian
period and in the Greek colonies of Italy. But no ruin,
no reference in literature comes to our aid. The supposition
that the King's Hall (<i>basileios stoa</i>) in Athens, the official residence
of the King Archon, was the prototype of all basilicas,
has little to support it; our information in regard to the form of
this building is quite inadequate, and the name alone warrants
no positive conclusion. It is more probable that both the name
and the architectural type came from the 'royal hall' of one of
the successors of Alexander.</p>

<p>A basilica was a spacious hall which served as an extension
of a market place, and was itself in a certain sense a covered
market. It was not limited to a specific purpose; in general,
whatever took place on the market square might take place in
the basilica, the roof of which afforded protection against the
weather. It was chiefly devoted, however, to business transactions
and to the administration of justice. The form is known
partly from the remains of the basilicas in Rome&mdash;Basilica
Julia, Basilica Ulpia, the Basilica of Constantine&mdash;and in
Africa, but more fully from the treatise of Vitruvius and the
description of a basilica which he himself erected at Fano.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;"><a name="fig023" id="fig023"></a>
<img src="images/fig023.jpg" width="250" height="110" alt="" />

<li><i>a.</i> Entrance court.</li>
<li>1. Corridor.</li>
<li>2.  Main room.</li>
<li>3. Tribunal.</li>
<li>4.  Rooms at the ends of the tribunal.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>According to these sources
the plan of a typical basilica
is essentially that of the building
before us (<a href="#fig023">Fig. 23</a>). An
oblong space is divided by columns
into a broad central hall
and a corridor which runs
around the four sides. The
height of the columns, in the
typical basilica, is equal to the width of the corridor, which is
covered by a flat roof; the inner edge of this roof is carried
by the entablature above the columns. The main room is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
higher than the corridor. Above the entablature is a low wall
on which there is a second row of columns; these carry the
main roof and form a clerestory, the light being admitted
through the intercolumniations.</p>

<p>The main hall and the corridor were devoted to trade; the
dealers perhaps occupied the former, while in the latter the
throng of purchasers and idlers moved freely about. The place
set aside for the administration of justice, the tribunal, was
ordinarily an apse projecting from the rear end. In our Basilica,
however,&mdash;and in some others as well,&mdash;it was a small
oblong elevated room back of the central hall, toward which it
opened in its whole length.</p>

<p>This ideal plan would answer very well for that of the early
Christian basilicas, excepting in one respect; instead of a corridor
on all four sides they have only aisles parallel with the
nave, an arrangement which had already been adopted in some
basilicas designed for markets. The Christian basilicas would
give us a still truer idea of the arrangement and lighting of the
pagan prototype if in most cases a part of the numerous windows
had not been walled up, thus producing a dimness in keeping
with a religious but not a secular edifice.</p>

<p>In pagan structures the ideal plan was by no means strictly
followed. Vitruvius himself at Fano, and the architects of
other basilicas the remains of which have been discovered, did
not hesitate to depart from it. So the Basilica at Pompeii, as
we shall see, presents a modification of the general plan in an
important particular, the admission of light; and this deviation
was carried out with finer artistic feeling than was displayed by
Vitruvius in his building.</p>

<p>Our Basilica is undoubtedly of later date than the Basilica
Porcia, but the Pompeians, who at the time when it was built
were pupils of the Greeks in matters of art, found their model
not in Rome but in a Greek city, perhaps Naples.</p>

<p>Five entrances, separated by tufa pillars, lead from the colonnade
of the Forum into the east end of the basilica. First comes
a narrow entrance court (<i>a</i>), extending across the entire building
and open to the sky. On the walls, as also on the outside
of the building, are remains of a simple stucco decoration;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
below, a yellow base with a projecting red border along the
upper edge; above, a plain white surface. At the left outside
the entrance court is a cistern for rain water collected from the
roof; the stairway close by (shown on the plan) had nothing to
do with the Basilica, but was connected with the upper gallery
of the colonnade about the Forum.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig024" id="fig024"></a>
<img src="images/fig024.jpg" width="538" height="316" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 24.&mdash;View of the Basilica, looking toward the tribunal.</p>
</div>

<p>Mounting four steps of basalt we pass from the narrow court
into the building. The five entrances here are separated by
four columns. Those next to the two sides on the right and on
the left were closed by a wall in which was a wide doorway; the
three at the middle were left as open intercolumniations. The
enclosed space before us measures 180⅓ English feet (200 Oscan
feet) in length, 78¾ feet in breadth. Twenty-eight massive brick
columns, 4 Oscan feet in diameter, separate the great central
hall from the broad corridor running about it; only the
lower part of the columns, built of small bricks evidently made
specially for this purpose, is preserved (<a href="#fig024">Fig. 24</a>). Attached
half-columns, with a diameter a little more than three fourths
that of the others, project from the walls; the wall decoration,
which imitates in stucco a veneering of colored marbles, is of
the first style (<a href="#Page_41">p. 41</a>). The columns of the entrance and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
those at the rear have the same diameter as the half-columns;
part of the Ionic capitals belonging to them have
been found, but the capitals of the large columns have wholly
disappeared.</p>

<p>There are only scanty remains of the floor, which consisted
of bits of brick and tile mixed with fine mortar and pounded
down (<i>opus Signinum</i>); it extended in a single level over the
whole enclosed space, and from this level our estimates of
height are reckoned. On three sides of the main hall near
the base of the columns under the floor is a square water
channel, indicated on our plan; eight rectangular basins lie
along its course, but the purpose of it is not clear. The tribunal
projects from the rear wall, its floor being six Oscan feet
above that of the rest of the building.</p>

<p>The large columns about the main hall, with a diameter
of more than 3½ feet, must have been at least 32 or 33
feet high; the attached half-columns with the columns at
the entrance and at the rear, including the Ionic capitals,
were probably not more than 20 feet high. But assuming that
the roof of the corridor was flat, the walls must have been
as high as the entablature of the large columns, and so must
have extended above the entablature of the half-columns;
considerable portions of this upper division of the walls
remain.</p>

<p>Along the walls on the ground are to be seen a number of
capitals, fragments of shafts and bases belonging to a series of
smaller columns with a diameter of 1.74 feet, all found in the
course of the excavations. They are of tufa, coated with white
stucco; they can belong only here, and by the study of their
forms&mdash;columns, half-columns, and peculiarly shaped three-quarter-columns&mdash;the
upper division of the walls can be restored
with some degree of certainty. Not to go into technical
details, in the upper part of the side walls a section of wall containing
a window alternated with a short series of columns in
which the columns, for the sake of greater solidity, were set
twice as close as the half-columns in the lower division of the
wall, the intercolumniations being left entirely open (<a href="#fig025">Fig. 25</a>);
over the entrances at the front the wall was continuous but was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
divided into sections by half-columns corresponding with the
columns below, a window being placed between every two half-columns
in order to conceal the difference in width between the
sections of wall at the front and those at the sides. The arrangement
was similar at the rear, on either side of the tribunal, as
may be seen from the section (<a href="#fig027">Fig. 27</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig025" id="fig025"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 25.&mdash;Exterior of the Basilica, restored.</p>
</div>

<p>With this restoration of the outer walls completed we are able
to form a clear idea of the appearance of the main hall. Whether
or not the rafters could be seen from below is uncertain, but the
probability is that, as assumed in our restoration (<a href="#fig026">Fig. 26</a>), they
were hidden by a coffered ceiling. The simple and beautiful
interior abounded in fine spatial effects. The corridor and main
room were almost as high as the main room was wide, that
is between 35 and 40 feet. The light streaming in through
the openings in the upper portion of the walls was evenly
distributed throughout the hall; we may assume that when
the sun became too hot on the south side it could be shut out
by curtains.</p>

<p>In our Basilica, then, we notice a wide divergence from the
ideal or normal plan. Instead of a clerestory above the main
hall a proportionally greater height is given to the corridor.
The normal height of a basilica corridor is represented by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
lower division of the walls with the attached half-columns and
their entablature; this, however, is here treated simply as a
lower member, and upon it, rather than upon the entablature
of the columns about the main hall, was placed an upper
division of wall admitting light and air through intercolumniations
and windows.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig026" id="fig026"></a>
<img src="images/fig026.jpg" width="498" height="357" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 26.&mdash;Interior of the Basilica, looking toward the tribunal, restored.</p>
</div>
<p>The tribunal at the rear is the most prominent and architecturally
the most effective portion of the building. The base is
treated in a bold, simple manner; upon it, at the front, stands a
row of columns the lower portions of which show traces of
latticework. The decoration of the walls, like that of the rest
of the interior, imitates a veneering of colored marbles. The
shape and comparatively narrow dimensions of the elevated
room indicate that we have here a tribunal in the strict sense, a
raised platform for the judge and his assistants; in the basilicas
provided with apses the latter were large enough to make
room both for the judicial body and for the litigants. Here the
litigants stood on the floor in front of the tribunal, and when
court was in session the general public must have been excluded
from this part of the corridor. The arrangement in this respect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
was far from convenient, but seemingly convenience was sacrificed
to aesthetic considerations; the builders wished to treat the
projecting front of the tribunal as an ornament to the building.</p>

<div class="figright"><a name="fig027" id="fig027"></a>
<img src="images/fig027.jpg" width="343" height="201" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 27.&mdash;Front of the tribunal&mdash;plan and elevation.</p>
</div>
<p>Under the tribunal was a vaulted chamber half below the
level of the ground; two round holes, indicated on the plan,
opened into it from above. It could hardly have been designed
as a place for the confinement of prisoners; escape would have
been easy by means of two windows in the rear, especially
when help was rendered
from the outside.
More likely it
was used, in connection
with the business
of the court, as a
storeroom, in which
writing materials and
the like, or even documents,
might be
kept; they could easily
have been passed
up through the holes when needed. The second story of the
tribunal was not as completely open to the main hall as the
first. Its front, the remains of which have for the most part
been recovered, was divided off by half-columns corresponding
in number and arrangement with the columns of the first story,
but each half-column was flanked by narrow pilasters, while a
parapet of moderate height occupied the intervening spaces.
It was built apparently with a view to architectural effect rather
than practical use (<a href="#fig027">Fig. 27</a>).</p>

<p>At the right and the left of the tribunal are places for stairways.
Each of these contains a landing on the same level with
the floor of the tribunal, from which it was cut off by a door;
the steps connecting with these landings, being of wood, have
disappeared. In both stair rooms, however, flights of stone
steps lead down to the vaulted chamber below, so that this
could not have been accessible if there were wooden steps on
both sides connecting the tribunal with the floor of the Basilica.
Probably on one side the wooden steps led from the tribunal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
down to the floor, but on the other ascended from the corresponding
landing to the second story, thus leaving the stairway
to the lower room unobstructed on that side. At some later
time the door at the left between the tribunal and the landing
was walled up, perhaps because the gallery was no longer used;
if still in use it could to all appearances have been reached only
by a ladder.</p>

<p>The two open rooms at the rear on either side of the tribunal
agree in their decoration with the entrance court except that
the base with its border is higher, and the white surface above
is moulded in stucco so as to give the appearance of slabs of
white marble. They were no higher than the first division of
the wall; the windows seen in <a href="#fig027">Fig. 27</a> above the broad entrances
opened into the outer air. Perhaps they were used as waiting
rooms for litigants.</p>

<p>Opposite the north entrance between two columns stood
a curb like those over the mouths of cisterns; only the foundation
stone with a circular opening is preserved. The remains
of a lead pipe, which brought the water to it, show that it must
have been connected with an aqueduct. At the further end of
the main hall was an equestrian statue of which no trace has
been found.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the roof is a problem of much difficulty.
Without wearying the reader by presenting various possibilities,
it will be sufficient for our purposes to suggest the explanation
which, on the whole, has the most in its favor. As assumed in
our restoration, the roof of the main hall was carried by the
entablature of the twenty-eight large columns. Thus in general
the arrangement corresponded fairly well with that of other
basilicas except that, owing to the lack of a clerestory, the roof
of the main hall was not much if any higher than that of the
corridor. From the flat roof of the corridor, at least on the
south side, the rain water flowed into the cistern near the front
part of the building.</p>

<p>The five entrances opening from the Forum into the narrow
court could be closed by latticed doors. Similar doors hung
also on the wooden jambs of the north and south entrances.
With such doors a complete safeguarding could not have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
been contemplated. Tradespeople using the Basilica must
either have removed their wares at the close of business hours
or have made the stalls sufficiently secure for protection. We
can hardly doubt that ordinarily a night watchman was on
duty about the building.

<h3>CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE TEMPLE OF APOLLO</i></span></h3>

<p>In some respects the study of the large temple on the west
side of the Forum is especially satisfactory. The building had
been completely restored after the earthquake of 63, and was
in good order at the time of its destruction. Though ancient
excavators removed many objects of value, including the statue
of the divinity of the temple,
much was left undisturbed, as
the interesting series of statues
in the court; in addition, a
number of inscriptions have
been recovered. On the whole,
more complete information is
at hand regarding this sanctuary
than in reference to any
other in Pompeii.</p>

<div class="figleft"><a name="fig028" id="fig028"></a>
<img src="images/fig028.jpg" width="271" height="209" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 28.&mdash;Corner of mosaic floor, cella of
the temple of Apollo.</p>
</div>

<p>The identification of this as
the temple of Apollo is certain.
The accompanying illustration shows a corner of the floor laid
over the greater part of the cella (3 on the plan); the parts
along the inner walls were of white mosaic. This floor was
composed of small, lozenge-shaped pieces of green and white
marble and slate; of the two narrow stripes between the lozenge
pattern and the bright mosaic fret along the border one is of
slate, the other of red marble. In the slate stripe was an inscription.
The letters were outlined by means of small holes
filled with metal, every seven holes forming a vertical line,
every four a horizontal. The inscription, which was in Oscan,
stated that the quaestor O[ppius] Camp[anius], by order of the
council and with money belonging to Apollo, had caused something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
to be made;<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> what this was cannot be determined, as the
important word is missing, but apparently it was the floor. In
the cella, moreover, stands a block of tufa, having the shape of
half an egg; this is the Omphalos, the familiar symbol of
Apollo. In the court on the first pilaster at the right as you
enter a tripod is painted, too large for mere decoration, and
explicable only as a symbol of the god. Lastly, in the design
of the stucco ornamentation with
which the entablature of the peristyle was
adorned after the earthquake, the principal
figures are griffins. The griffin was sacred
to Apollo, and though it was often used as
a purely decorative theme, in this case a
reference to the divinity of the temple is
unmistakable (<a href="#fig031">Fig. 31</a>).</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p>As previously stated (<a href="#Page_49">p. 49</a>), the deviation
of the axis of this building from that of the
Forum is undoubtedly due to the fact that
it followed the direction of a street which
bordered it on the east side before the colonnade
of Popidius was built; this is therefore
an evidence of the antiquity of the
temple. The style of architecture, however,
is in no essential particular different from
that of the colonnade and of other buildings
of the Tufa Period, and gives no indication of great age. The
most probable explanation is that the temple was rebuilt in the
Tufa Period on the site of an earlier structure, the orientation of
which was preserved. The difference in direction is concealed
by the increasing thickness, from south to north, of the pillars
between the Forum and the court of the temple. The spaces
between the pillars were originally left open. Later, at what
time it is impossible to determine, they were all walled up except
the three opposite the side of the temple; since the temple was
excavated these also have been closed. In comparison with
the entrances from the Forum, at first ten in number, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
one on the south side, opening on the street leading from
the Porta Marina, must have been considered unimportant.
Otherwise pains would have been taken to give to the colonnade
on that side an even number of columns, so that the door
of the temple should face an intercolumniation; as it is the
number is uneven and the entrance to the court had to be put a
little to one side that it might not open upon a column.</p>

<p>The court is of oblong shape. The continuous colonnade
about the sides, the peristyle, was originally in two stories. At
the rear of the peristyle on the north side stood the small colonnade
of the Doric order already mentioned (<a href="#Page_62">p. 62</a>); one of the
rooms into which in later times this was divided (6) was connected
with the court of the temple, and was probably occupied
by the sacristan (<i>aedituus</i>).</p>

<p>The temple stood upon a high podium, in front of which is a
broad flight of steps. The small cella was evidently intended
for but one statue. The columns at the sides of the deep portico,
which in other respects follows the Etruscan plan (<a href="#Page_63">p. 63</a>),
are continued in a colonnade which is carried completely around
the cella.</p>

<p>In <a href="#plate02">Plate II</a> and <a href="#fig030">Fig. 30</a> we give a view of the ruins as they
are to-day; in <a href="#fig032">Fig. 32</a> a view of the temple as it appeared
before the earthquake of 63. The height and diameter of the
Corinthian columns seen in the restoration can be calculated with
approximate correctness; of the entablature and parts above
nothing has been found except a large waterspout of terra cotta
in the form of a lion's head.</p>

<p>The colonnade about the court was built of tufa, and coated
with white stucco. It presents an odd mixture of styles, of
which other examples also are found at Pompeii; a Doric entablature
with triglyphs was placed upon Ionic columns having
the four-sided capital known as Roman Ionic. Here, as in the
earlier colonnade about the Forum, the stone blocks of the
entablature were set upon beams; and in the blocks now in
place we may see the sockets made to receive the ends of the
joists of the second story floor. Evidently with the purpose of
supporting this second story, which was probably of the Corinthian
order, the Ionic columns below were made relatively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
short. No remains of an upper gallery, however, have been
found; and it is quite possible that when the colonnade was
restored, after the earthquake, the second story was omitted.
The upper floor could be reached from the second story of
the small colonnade north of the court, which was accessible
by means of a stairway leading from the Forum.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 30.&mdash;View of the temple of Apollo, looking toward Vesuvius.
At the left of the steps, the column on which was the sundial; in front of the steps, the altar.</p>
</div>

<p>When the restoration of the temple and its colonnade was
undertaken, the feeling for the pure and simple forms of the
Greek architecture was no longer present; the prevailing taste
demanded gay and fantastic designs, with the use of brilliant
colors. The Pompeians improved the opportunity afforded by
the rebuilding to make the temple and its colonnade conform
to the taste of the times.</p>

<p>First the projecting portions of the Ionic and Corinthian
capitals were cut off; then shaft and capital alike were covered
with a thick layer of stucco. New capitals were moulded in
the stucco, of a shape in general resembling the Corinthian,
and were painted in red, blue, and yellow; the lower part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
the shaft, unfluted, was also painted yellow. The entablature,
at least in the case of the colonnade, was in like manner covered
with stucco and ornamented with reliefs in the same colors.
All this gaudy stucco has now fallen off; and our illustration
(<a href="#fig031">Fig. 31</a>) is taken from Mazois, who made the drawing soon
after the court was excavated. The later capitals and stucco
ornamentation of the temple itself had wholly disappeared
before the excavations were made.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig031" id="fig031"></a>
<img src="images/fig031.jpg" width="487" height="294" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 31.&mdash;Section of the entablature of the temple of Apollo, showing the original form
and the restoration after the earthquake.</p>
</div>

<p>The wall decoration of both the temple and the colonnade
was originally in the first style; a remnant of it may still be
seen in the cella. After 63 it was modernized. The walls of
the temple both within and without were done over in stucco,
so as to resemble ashlar work of white marble; apparently it
was the intention to give the appearance of real marble. The
walls of the colonnade were painted in the latest Pompeian style,
in bright colors, on a white ground. The decorative designs, to
judge from the remains and from sketches, were not of special
interest. There was a series of pictures representing scenes
from the Trojan War,&mdash;the quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon,
the embassy of the Greeks to Achilles, the battle
between Achilles and Hector (the subject of this, however, is
doubtful), the dragging of Hector's body about the walls of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Troy, Priam making entreaty for the body of Hector, and the
rape of the Palladium,&mdash;but they have long since perished and
are known only from unsatisfactory drawings.</p>

<p>Long before this modernizing of the temple the west side of
the court had undergone a complete transformation. The peculiar
bend in the street at the northwest corner (shown in <a href="#plan2">Plan
II</a>), the diagonal line with which the small colonnade north of
the court ends, and the narrow, quite inaccessible space between
the west wall of the court and the houses lying near it, cannot
easily be explained as a part of an original plan, but must rather
be the result of later changes. The north and south street
which now ends abruptly at the northwest corner must originally
have been continued through the west colonnade, the ends of
which were left open; this colonnade was then a public thoroughfare,
on which the windows of houses opened, and perhaps
also doors.</p>

<p>We learn from an inscription that about the year 10 B.C. the
city purchased from the residents whose property adjoined the
colonnade, for the sum of 3000 sesterces (about $155), the right
to build a wall in front of their windows; this explains how the
narrow space between the wall on the north side of the court
and the houses came to be cut off. The inscription reads: <i>M.
Holconius Rufus d[uum] v[ir] i[uri] d[icundo] tert[ium], C.
Egnatius Postumus d. v. i. d. iter[um] ex d[ecurionum] d[ecreto]
ius luminum opstruendorum &#65944; ∞ ∞ ∞ redemerunt, parietemque
privatum Col[oniae] Ven[eriae] Cor[neliae] usque ad
tegulas faciundum coerarunt</i>,&mdash;'Marcus Holconius Rufus, duumvir
with judiciary authority for the third time, and Gaius Egnatius
Postumus, duumvir with judiciary authority for the second
time, in accordance with a decree of the city council purchased
for 3000 sesterces the right to shut off light (from adjoining
buildings) and caused to be constructed a wall belonging to the
colony of Pompeii to the height of the tiles,' that is, as high as
the roofs of the houses.</p>

<p>The wall referred to was no doubt that on the west side of the
court of the temple; when it was built the ends of the colonnade
on that side must have been closed, so that this ceased to
be a thoroughfare. Marcus Holconius was duumvir for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
fourth time in the year 3-2 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>; as an interval of at least five
years must intervene between two duumvirates, his third duumvirate
must have been not far from 10 <span class="s08">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The pedestal in the cella, on which the statue of Apollo
stood, still remains, but no trace of the statue itself has been
found.</p>

<img src="images/fig032.jpg" width="392" height="255" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 32.&mdash;Temple of Apollo, restored.</p>
</div>

<p>Near the foot of the steps in front is a large altar of travertine,
having the same inscription on both sides: <i>M. Porcius M. f.,
L. Sextilius L. f., Cn. Cornelius Cn. f., A. Cornelius A. f.
IIII vir[i] d[e] d[ecurionum] s[ententia] f[aciundum] locar[unt]</i>,&mdash;'Marcus
Porcius the son of Marcus, Lucius Sextilius
the son of Lucius, Gnaeus Cornelius the son of Gnaeus, and
Aulus Cornelius the son of Aulus, the Board of Four, in
accordance with the vote of the city council let the contract
(for building this altar).' The names of the four officials who
erected the altar, the two duumvirs and two aediles (for the
title see <a href="#Page_12">p. 12</a>), appear without surnames; this points to a
relatively early time, at the latest the age of Augustus.</p>

<p>At the left of the steps is an Ionic column with the inscription:
<i>L. Sepunius L. f. Sandilianus, M. Herennius A. f. Epidianus
duovir[i] i[uri] d[icundo] d[e] s[ua] p[ecunia]
f[aciundum] c[urarunt]</i>,&mdash;'Lucius Sepunius Sandilianus the
son of Lucius, and Marcus Herennius Epidianus the son of
Aulus, duumvirs with judiciary authority, caused (this) to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
erected at their own expense.' Old sketches, made soon after
the court was excavated, represent the column with a sundial
on the top. The probability that a sundial belonging to the
column was actually found is increased by the fact that these
same men placed one on the circular bench in the Forum Triangulare.
Here, in front of the temple of the Sun-god, such a
dial would certainly have been in place. At the right of the
steps are some blocks of lava containing holes, in which, undoubtedly,
the supports of a votive offering were once set, but the
holes give no clew to the size or character of the offering.</p>

<p>Other divinities besides Apollo were honored in this sanctuary,
which in the earlier time was evidently the most important in
the city; statues and altars for their worship were placed in
the court. The pedestals of the statues still remain where they
were originally placed, on the step in front of the stylobate of
the colonnade; the statues themselves, with one exception,
have been taken to Naples. There were in all six of them,
grouped in three related pairs. In front of the third column
at the left of the entrance, stood Venus, at the right was a
hermaphrodite&mdash;both marble figures of about one half life size.
They belong to the pre-Roman period and were originally of
good workmanship, but even in antiquity they had been repeatedly
restored and worked over. As a work of art, the hermaphrodite
is the more important.</p>

<p>An altar stands before the statue of Venus. In pre-Roman
times this may have been the only shrine in the city at which
worship was offered to Herentas; for by that name the goddess
of love was known in the native speech. Venus as goddess
of the Roman colony (<a href="#fig004">Fig. 4</a>), was represented in an
altogether different guise, and had a special place of worship
elsewhere (see <a href="#Page_124">pp. 124</a>-<a href="#Page_129">129</a>).</p>

<p>Though the statues of Venus and of the hermaphrodite here
form a pair, both artistically and in respect to arrangement, the
latter belongs not to the cycle of Venus but to that of Bacchus;
and in order to make this the more evident, the ears of a satyr
were given to the figure. We may, perhaps, infer that the god
of wine also was worshipped in this sanctuary. In the sacristan's
room (6 on the plan) we find a painting in which Bacchus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
is represented as leaning upon Silenus who is playing the lyre,
meanwhile allowing the panther to drink out of his cup. This
seems strange enough in a temple of Apollo; still it cannot be
considered conclusive evidence that Bacchus actually received
worship here. Without doubt the Wine-god was honored in
Pompeii, the region about which was rich in vines. He appears
countless times in wall paintings, but no shrine dedicated to him
has yet been found.</p>

<p>On the right side of the court, in front of the third column,
was a statue of Apollo; on the left directly opposite stood
Artemis, both life size figures in bronze. An altar stood
before the statue of Artemis; the altar of Apollo was before
the temple. Both statues were armed with the bow, and it is
evident that they were not designed to stand facing each other,
but side by side, or one behind the other; both may originally
have belonged to a Niobe group. As works of art, they are
not of high merit. We recognize a certain elegance and nicety
of finish, but these qualities cannot compensate for superficiality
in the treatment of the figure, want of expression in the faces,
and lack of energy in the movement. We have no other evidence
of the worship of Artemis in Pompeii.</p>

<p>Further on, in front of the fifth column on either side, was
a marble herm. That on the right is still in place and is
seen in <a href="#plate02">Plate II</a>. It is of fine workmanship, and clearly
belongs to the pre-Roman period; it represents Hermes, or Mercury.
The god appears as a youth standing with his mantle
drawn over the back of his head; the face, with a placid,
serious, mild expression, is inclined a little forward. In this
form Mercury was honored as the presiding divinity of the
palaestra, the god of gymnastic exercises; we shall find him in
the same guise later in the court of the Stabian Baths <a href="#Page_200">(p. 200</a>).
How this type of Hermes came to be chosen for the place of
honor in athletic courts is by no means clear; it was certainly
designed originally to represent him as a god of death, the
Psychopompus, conductor of souls to the Underworld. The
worship of Mercury here as a god of gymnastic exercises would
not be in harmony with the surroundings; we should rather
believe that the Pompeians, having placed him in such close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
relation with Apollo, god of the death-dealing shaft, and the earth
goddess, Maia, associated more serious ideas with his image.</p>

<img src="images/plate02.jpg" width="600" height="413" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PLATE II.&mdash;COURT OF THE TEMPLE OF APOLLO</p>
</div>

<p>The herm on the opposite side of the court probably represented
Maia. No trace of it has been found; the female herm
in the Naples Museum formerly assigned to this place is now
known to have been brought from Rome. In Greek mythology,
the mother of Hermes was Maia, the daughter of Atlas; and
this relationship, by a common confusion, was transferred to the
Italian Maia, who was originally goddess of the spring, and gave
her name to the month of May. The assignment of the herm
opposite Mercury to Maia is based upon a number of inscriptions
which establish the existence of a cult of Mercury and
Maia in Pompeii. From the same source we learn that with
the worship of these two that of Augustus was intimately associated;
there are few better illustrations of the development of
emperor worship in the Early Empire.</p>

<p>These inscriptions were found in different places, none of
them in their original location. They are dedications once
attached to votive offerings, of which one was set up each year
by a college of priests, consisting of slaves and freedmen, under
the general direction of the city authorities. The official title
of this college at first, certainly to 14 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, was <i>Ministri Mercurii
Maiae</i>, 'Servants of Mercury and Maia'; the word <i>minister</i>
indicates a low order of priesthood. The worship of the emperor
was then added, and the priests were called 'Servants of
Augustus, Mercury, and Maia.' Still later, at least as early as
2 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, the names of the two divinities were dropped, and the
priests were designated simply as 'Servants of Augustus.'</p>

<p>The extant inscriptions of this series come down to the year
40 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> As an example, we give that of 2 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, in which the
<i>ministri Augusti</i> first appear: <i>N. Veius Phylax, N. Popidius
Moschus, T. Mescinius Amphio, Primus Arrunti M. s., min.

Phylax, Numerius Popidius Moschus, Titus Mescinius Amphio
and Primus the slave of Marcus Arruntius, Servants of Augustus

the order of Marcus Holconius Rufus, duumvir with judiciary
authority for the fourth time, Aulus Clodius Flaccus, duumvir
for the third time, and of Publius Caesetius Postumus and
Numerius Tintirius Rufus, duumvirs in charge of the streets,
buildings, and public religious festivals (the official title of the
aediles, <a href="#Page_13">p. 13</a>) in the thirteenth consulship of the Emperor
Caesar (Augustus), the other consul being Marcus Plautius
Silvanus.'</p>

<p>It is not difficult to understand how the worship of Augustus
came to have a place in this sanctuary. The divinities here
honored stood in close relation to him. Apollo was his tutelary
divinity, to whom he thought that he owed the victory at Actium,
and in whose honor he built the magnificent temple on the
Palatine. Venus, moreover, was revered as the ancestress of
the Julian family; and finally Mercury was said to be incarnate
in Augustus himself.</p>

<p>This last conception found expression in one of the finest of
the odes of Horace, written in 28 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> Fearful portents, the
poet says, are threatening Rome; Jupiter with flaming right
hand has even struck his own temple on the Capitoline. To
what god shall we turn for help&mdash;to Apollo, to Venus, or to
Mars? or rather to thee, winged god, Maia's son, that even now
doest walk the earth in the form of a youth, the avenger of
Caesar:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Sive mutata iuvenem figura</p>
<p>Ales in terris imitaris almae</p>
<p>Filius Maiae, patiens vocari</p>
<p class="i4">Caesaris ultor.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It is interesting to note that evidence of the worship of
Augustus as Mercury has come to light also in Egypt. In an
inscription from Denderah we find <i>Helmîs Kaisar</i>, 'beloved of
Ptah and of Isis'; Helmîs Kaisar is apparently 'Hermes
Caesar,' and in Egyptian inscriptions Augustus is elsewhere
referred to as 'the beloved of Ptah and of Isis.'

<h3>CHAPTER XI<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE BUILDINGS AT THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF THE
FORUM, AND THE TABLE OF STANDARD MEASURES</i></span></h3>

<p>The large building at the northwest corner of the Forum
(<a href="#fig033">Fig. 33</a>, 1, 2, 3) was erected after the earthquake of the year
63. We do not know whether at the time of the eruption it
had yet been roofed; the inside at least was in an unfinished
state.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 225px;"><a name="fig033" id="fig033"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 33.&mdash;Plan of the buildings
at the northwest corner of the

<ul class="cap-list">
<li>1. City treasury.</li>
<li>2. Latrina.</li>
<li>3, 4. Market buildings.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>This building is divided into three parts, one of which, that
furthest north, at the corner, contains both lower and upper
rooms. Below, at the level of the Forum,
are two dark vaulted chambers, one at the
rear of the other. The front chamber is
dimly lighted by a slit in the ceiling and
was entered from the Forum by a narrow
door; there are traces of a strong iron
grating in the doorway. It has been supposed,
not without probability, that these
were the vaults of the city treasury, the
aerarium; if they had been built for
prison cells, they would naturally have
had separate entrances.</p>

<p>Above these chambers are two rooms
which open not on the Forum, but on the
street that runs past them on the north
(1, 1). They resemble shops and would
be classed as such without further question but for the fact that
the level of the floor is nearly five feet above the sidewalk, so
that they could have been reached only by means of steps. If
the identification of the chambers below as the vaults of the
city treasury is correct, these rooms must have been occupied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
by the treasury officials, who could here transact business with
the public without admitting the latter to their offices.</p>

<p>The middle room (2) was a public closet, with a small anteroom.
As the doors to and from the anteroom were not placed
opposite each other, the interior was not visible from the street.
The room was not entirely finished; nevertheless, we can see
the water channel running along three sides, and above it the
stones on which the woodwork was to be placed; the inlet
pipe was in position, as well as the outlet for carrying the water
off into a sewer at the rear.</p>

<p>The last of the three parts of the building (3) is by far the
largest. It was a high and spacious hall, with numerous
entrances from the Forum. It was divided into two rooms by
two short sections of wall projecting from the sides, and was
evidently a market house, perhaps for vegetables and farm
products.</p>

<p>The rooms formed by enclosing the small colonnade at the
rear of the court of Apollo have already been mentioned (<a href="#Page_62">p. 62</a>).
At the left of the stairway leading to the second story (shown
in <a href="#plan2">Plan II</a>) is a small room which opens in its entire breadth
upon the Forum (11). Close by is a recess (10), also open
toward the Forum, in the side of the first of the thick pillars
which separate the Forum from the court of the temple.</p>

<p>In this recess stood the table of standard measures, <i>mensa
ponderaria</i> (<a href="#fig034">Fig. 34</a>), which is now in the Naples Museum, unfortunately
not entire; a part of it has disappeared. The part
remaining consists of a large slab of limestone (a little over 8
feet long and 1.8, or 2 Oscan feet, wide), in which are nine
bowl-shaped cavities with holes at the bottom through which
the contents could be drawn off; this slab rested on two stone
supports, and similar supports above it carried another slab,
which is now lost, with three cavities. The table thus contained
twelve standards of capacity for liquid and dry measure,
but only ten are shown in the illustration, as two are too far
back.</p>

<p>It is evident that the table has come down from the pre-Roman
period. The names of the measures were originally
written in Oscan, beside the five largest cavities, and though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
the letters were later erased, they are still in part legible.
Only one word, however, can be made out with certainty, beside
the next to the smallest cavity; that is <i>Kuiniks</i>, plainly the
same as the Greek
<i>Choinix</i>. We naturally
infer that in
the pre-Roman
time the Pompeians
used Greek
measures.</p>

<div class="figright"><a name="fig034" id="fig034"></a>
<img src="images/fig034.jpg" width="364" height="341" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 34.&mdash;Table of standard measures, <i>mensa ponderaria</i>.<br />
<a href="images/fig034fs.jpg">View larger image</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>In the time of
Augustus, about 20
<span class="s08">B.C.</span>, the cavities
were enlarged and
made to conform to
the Roman standard,
but the new names
were not put
beside them. The
inscription on the
front of the larger slab has reference to these changes: 'Aulus
Clodius Flaccus, the son of Aulus, and Numerius Arcaeus
Arellianus Caledus, the son of Numerius, duumvirs with judiciary
authority, in accordance with a decree of the city council,
caused the measures to be made equal' to the Roman measures.</p>

<p>A  similar adjustment of measures to the Roman standard is
indicated by the use of the phrase <i>metra exaequare</i> on a
table found at Minturnae. The adoption of a uniform standard
was made a subject of imperial regulation by Augustus, who, by
this means, sought to promote the unification of the Empire.
Similar tables of measures have been found in various parts of
the Roman world, as at Selinunto in Sicily, in the Greek islands,
and at Bregenz on the Lake of Constance.</p>

<p>It is probable that an official charged with the oversight of
the measures had his office in the small room next to the stairway
(11).

<h3>CHAPTER XII<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE MACELLUM</i></span></h3>

<p>The large building at the northeast corner of the Forum was
a provision market, of the sort called <i>Macellum</i>. The name
Pantheon, once applied to it, is now abandoned, and there is no
longer the slightest doubt regarding its purpose, which is indicated
by its general plan, the remains found in the course of the
excavations, and the paintings upon the walls.</p>

<p>Such markets, where provisions, especially of the finer and
more expensive kinds, were sold and in which a cook also
might be secured, without doubt
existed in the Greek cities after
the time of Alexander; from the
Greeks, as in the case of the
basilica, the Romans took both
the name and the architectural
type.</p>

<li>7. Tholus.</li>
<li>8. Pen.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The first macellum in Rome
was built in 179 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> in connection
with the enlargement
of a fish market. In later
times, as we learn from inscriptions,
others were constructed
in Rome and in various cities of Italy and the provinces.</p>

<p>A macellum built by Nero is shown on one of the coins of
this emperor. It agrees in essential points with our building,
having stalls or shops of more than one story in height, and
at the middle of the court a structure with a dome-like roof.
The central structure, the <i>tholus</i>, is mentioned by Varro as an
essential part of a macellum, but its use is known to us only
from the remains found at Pompeii.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<p>The plan of our building is simple. A court in the shape of
a rectangle, slightly longer than it is broad, is surrounded by a
deep colonnade on the four sides. In the middle twelve bases,
arranged so as to form a dodecagon, supported an equal number
of columns on which a roof rested; underneath was a rectangular
basin in the pavement, from which a covered drain led toward
the southeast corner. Under this roof the fish that had been
sold were scaled, the scales being thrown into the basin, where
they were found in great quantity. Behind the colonnade on
the south side, and opening into it, was a row of market stalls or
small shops (3 on the plan). Above these were upper rooms, in
front of which was a wooden gallery, but there was no stairway,
and apparently the shopkeeper who wished to use his second
story had to provide himself with a ladder.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig036" id="fig036"></a>
<img src="images/fig036.jpg" width="535" height="395" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 36.&mdash;View of the Macellum.<br />
In the foreground, part of the stylobate. In the middle ground, remains of the tholus.
In the background, at the middle, walls and pedestal of the imperial chapel; at the
right, market room; at the left, banquet room.</p>
</div>

<p>There were shops also on the north side, but they opened
upon the street bounding the Macellum on the north; a southern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
exposure for the shop fronts seems to have been avoided on
account of the damage that the heat in summer might cause to
the stock. In the shops on this street&mdash;whether in those belonging
to the building or those on the opposite side is not stated&mdash;the
excavators found charred figs, chestnuts, plums, grapes, fruit
in glass vessels, lentils, grain, loaves of bread, and cakes. A
few shops behind the portico in front faced toward the Forum.</p>

<p>A large market room (4) opened on the colonnade at the southeast
corner, the entrance being divided by two columns. Along
three sides runs a counter for meat and fish, the surface of which
slopes toward the middle of the room. That fish were sold on the
left side is plain from the special arrangement made to carry off
the water; the floor behind the counter here was raised and
sloped toward the rear, where a gutter connecting with it, and
passing across the room, led under the counter on the south side
into the street.</p>

<p>In the little room or pen at the northeast corner of the
colonnade (8) remains of skeletons of sheep were found.
Such animals, then, were sold here alive; instead of buying
the flesh of slaughtered animals, many purchasers no doubt
preferred to obtain a victim which could be sacrificed as an
offering to the household gods before it was used for food.</p>

<p>The paintings on the walls of the colonnade are among
the best examples of the latest Pompeian style. Above the base
are large black panels with a broad red border; between them,
in the vertical spaces separating the border of one panel from
that of the next, are light and fantastic architectural designs in
yellow on a white ground, the parts designed to appear furthest
from the eye being in green and red. In this way a rich
development of architectural forms is united, in a consistent
and effective decorative scheme, with large panels suitable for
paintings.</p>

<p>Along the edges of the black panels run conventional plant
designs; in the middle are paintings symmetrically arranged in
a series in which a pair of floating figures alternates with a
mythological scene enclosed in a painted frame. Among the
mythological pictures are Ulysses before Penelope, who does not
recognize him, Io guarded by Argus, and Medea plotting the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
murder of her children. The whole arrangement is in excellent
taste, while the execution is careful and delicate.</p>

<p>The treatment of the upper part of the wall is especially worthy
of note. Generally in walls of the fourth style the portion
above the large panels is filled with airy architectural designs
upon a white or at least a bright ground. In this instance
the fantastic architectural forms in the spaces between the
black panels are continued upwards to the ceiling, and in the
midst of each group a standing figure is painted on a blue
ground&mdash;a girl with utensils for sacrifice, a satyr playing the
flute; but the spaces above the panels are completely filled with
representations of the things exposed for sale. Unfortunately
only a few of these pictures remain. One contains birds, some
alive, some killed and dressed; in another, different kinds of
fish are seen; and a third presents a variety of vessels in which
wine and other liquids could be kept. This departure from the
usual style of decoration, strikingly suggestive, can be explained
only as having a direct reference to the purpose of the building.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig037" id="fig037"></a>
<img src="images/fig037.jpg" width="533" height="316" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 37.&mdash;The Macellum, restored.</p>

<p>In two small pictures in the black panels of the north entrance
Cupids took the place of men. The Pompeians were very fond
of the representation of Cupids as engaged in human occupations;
it gave opportunity for the poetic treatment of everyday
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
life, which was thus carried over into fairyland. So in one
picture sprightly, winged little figures are celebrating the festival
of Vesta, the tutelary divinity of millers and bakers, who
on this day, just as appears in the painting, wreathed with
garlands their mills and much belabored asses that once a year
were thus admitted to a share in the festal celebrations of their
masters; the reference to trade in bread and flour is obvious.</p>

<p>In the other picture the Cupids
are plaiting and selling
wreaths; in view of the extensive
use of garlands at banquets
and on gala days the inference
is warranted that they, too, were
sold in this market. In the market
room for meat and fish there
is another interesting picture
representing the local divinities
of Pompeii&mdash;personifications of
the Sarno, of the coast, and of
the country round about, suggesting
that here the products
of the sea, the river, and the
land might be obtained.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 38.&mdash;Statue of Octavia, sister of Augustus,
found in the chapel of the Macellum.
She is represented in an attitude of worship,
with a libation saucer in her right
hand, and a box of incense in her left.</p>
</div>

<p>Besides the rooms thus far
considered, which served a practical
end, we find in the Macellum
two other rooms which gave
to the building a religious character
and placed it under the
special protection of the imperial house. One, at the middle
of the east end (5), is a chapel consecrated to the worship of
the emperors. The floor is raised above that of the rest of the
building, and the entrance is reached by five steps leading
up from the rear of the colonnade. On a pedestal against
the rear wall, and in four niches at the sides, were statues, of
which only the two in the niches at the right have been found;
these represent Octavia, the sister of Augustus (<a href="#fig038">Fig. 38</a>), and
Marcellus (<a href="#fig039">Fig. 39</a>), the hope of Augustus and of Rome, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
untimely death was lamented by Virgil in those touching verses
in the sixth book of the Aeneid. An arm with a globe was also
found, doubtless belonging to the statue of an emperor that stood
on the pedestal at the rear. The chapel contains no altar; sacrifice
was probably offered on a portable bronze coal pan in the
form of a tripod. Several beautiful examples of these movable
altars have been found, and there are numerous representations
of them in reliefs and in wall paintings.</p>

<p>The Macellum in its present form was at the time of the
eruption by no means an ancient building. While finished and
no doubt in use at the time of the earthquake of 63, it had
been built not many years before, in the reign of Claudius or of
Nero, in the place of an older structure which dated from the
pre-Roman period. The earlier Macellum, of which scanty but
indubitable traces remain, could not have contained a chapel for
the worship of the emperors; this was probably introduced into
the plan of the structure at the time of the rebuilding. The
most reasonable supposition is that the chapel was built in
honor of Claudius, and that his statue with the globe as a
symbol of world sovereignty stood on the pedestal at the rear,
while in the niches at the left were his wife Agrippina and
adopted son Nero.</p>

<p>We can hardly doubt that Claudius was worshipped in Pompeii
during his lifetime; it is known from inscriptions that
even before the death of Claudius Nero was honored with the
services of a special priest. That Octavia and Marcellus,
another mother with a son who was heir to the throne, should
be placed opposite Agrippina and Nero, was quite natural.
Claudius, who through his mother Antonia was the grandson of
Octavia, had great pride in this relationship, through which
alone he was connected with the family of Augustus; and from
Octavia, Agrippina and Nero also were descended, the former
as a daughter of Germanicus, Claudius's brother, and the latter
through his father Gnaeus Domitius, who was a son of the older
daughter of Octavia, also called Antonia. This thought was
suggested by the grouping of Octavia and Marcellus with Agrippina
and Nero: Octavia's descendants are now on the throne, as
Augustus intended that they should be; and Nero is the pride
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
and hope of the emperor and the Roman people, as once Marcellus
was.</p>

<p>The room at the left of the imperial chapel, with a wide
entrance divided by two columns (6), was also consecrated to
the worship of the emperors. It contains a low altar (shown
on the plan) of peculiar shape. A slab of black stone rests on
two marble steps; it has a raised rim about the edge with a
hole in one corner. Evidently this is an altar for drink offerings;
in this room sacrificial meals were partaken of, at which the
long estrade at the right, like a counter, nearly three feet high,
was perhaps used as a serving table. Such meals had an important
place among the functions of the Roman colleges of
priests, and some priesthood connected with the worship of the
emperors apparently had its place of meeting here; but whether
this was the college of the Seviri Augustales, composed of
freedmen, or a more aristocratic priesthood modelled after the
Sodales Augustales at Rome, cannot be determined. The purpose
of the niche in the corner, with the platform in front of it
approached by steps, is unknown.</p>

<p>In this room, also, there were two pictures containing Cupids.
In one they were represented as drinking wine and playing the
lyre; in the other, as engaged in acts of worship&mdash;both appropriate
decorative subjects for a room intended for sacrificial
banquets.</p>

<p>The Macellum was entered from three sides. At the front,
facing the Forum, was a portico consisting of two orders of
white marble columns, one above the other, supporting a roof.
Fragments of the Ionic or Corinthian columns belonging to the
lower order, and of the well proportioned intermediate entablature,
have been preserved. Statues stood at the foot of the
columns, as also at the ends of the party walls between the
shops at the rear of the portico, and beside the two columns
of the little vestibule at the entrance; between the two doors
was a small shrine, and here, too, was a statue.</p>

<p>The difference in direction between the front of the Macellum
and the side of the Forum is concealed by increasing the depth
of the shops from south to north, so that the depth of the
portico remained the same. The room at the extreme right,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
being so shallow that it could not be used as a shop, was made
into a shrine; the image or images set up in it must have been
very small. What divinities were worshipped here, unless the
Street Lares, cannot be
conjectured.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;"><a name="fig039" id="fig039"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 39.&mdash;Statue of Marcellus, son of Octavia, found
in the chapel of the Macellum.</p>
</div>

<p>There is another
entrance on the north
side, and a third near
the southeast corner.
In the latter are steps,
and at the left as you
come in is a small
niche under which two
serpents were painted.
This humble shrine was
probably dedicated to
the presiding divinity
of the building, the
Genius Macelli.</p>

<p>The colonnade of the
Macellum was thrown
down by the earthquake
of 63. At the time of
the eruption the stylobate
on which the columns
rested, and the gutter in front of it, had been renewed;
but only the columns on the north side and a part of those on
the west side had been set up again. Both the columns and
the entablature have entirely disappeared, in consequence of
excavations made in ancient times.

<h3>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE SANCTUARY OF THE CITY LARES</i></span></h3>

<p>In earlier times a street opened into the Forum south of the
Macellum. Later, apparently in the time of Augustus, it was
closed, and the end, together with adjoining space at the south,
was occupied by a building which measures approximately sixty
by seventy Roman feet.</p>

<p>In richness of material and architectural detail this was among
the finest edifices at Pompeii. Its walls and floors were completely
covered with marble. Now we see only rough masonry,
stripped of its veneering, but enough vestiges
remain to enable us to reconstruct
the whole; in <a href="#fig041">Figs. 41</a> and <a href="#fig042">42</a> both rear
and side views of the interior are given.</p>

</div>

<p>Opening into the main room at the rear
is a large apse (<a href="#fig040">Fig. 40</a>, 2), which gives to
the building a peculiar character. In the
inner part of the apse is a broad foundation
about six feet high, on which stood a
shrine (<i>aedicula</i>), containing a pedestal
for three statues of not more than life
size; the foundation projects in front of
the pedestal, forming a table for offerings. A base of the same
height as the foundation of the shrine runs along the walls of
the apse; it supported two columns and two attached half-columns
on the right, and the same number on the left.</p>

<p>On either side of the main room is a recess, <i>ala</i>, containing a
pedestal for a statue of more than life size. The two entrances
were flanked by pilasters nearly two Roman feet square, while
each entrance was divided into three parts by two columns.
There were three niches about six feet above the floor in each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
of the side walls of the main room, and two more at the rear;
all were originally flanked by small pilasters which rested on a
projecting base. The remains of an altar may still be seen in
the middle of the room.</p>

<p>The height of both side and rear walls can be approximately
computed from the existing remains, the basis of computation
for the side walls being the thickness of the pilasters at the
entrance. The rear part of the building was certainly not less
than 45 feet high, exclusive of the gable, while the sides could
not have been more than 30 or at most 35. This difference
in height, taken with other indications, obliges us to conclude
that the central room was treated as a paved court open to the
sky; only the apse and the wings were roofed.</p>

<p>It is evident that we have here a place of worship, yet not,
properly speaking, a temple. The shrine in the apse, with its
broad pedestal for several relatively small images, presents a
striking analogy to the shrines of the Lares found in so many
private houses. Cities, as well as households, had their guardian
spirits. The worship of these tutelary divinities was reorganized
by Augustus, who ordered that, just as the Genius of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
the master of the house was worshipped at the family shrine,
so his Genius should receive honor together with the Lares
of the different cities; thus in each city the emperor was to
be looked upon as a father, the head of the common household.
As the house had its shrine for the Lares, so also had
the city; that in Rome was near the spot on which the arch
of Titus was afterwards erected.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig042" id="fig042"></a>
<img src="images/fig042.jpg" width="536" height="362" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 42.&mdash;North side of the sanctuary of the City Lares, restored.</p>
</div>

<p>Undoubtedly we should recognize in this edifice the sanctuary
of the Lares of the city, <i>Lararium publicum</i>. On the pedestal
of the shrine in the apse the Genius of Augustus probably
stood, represented by a statue of the emperor himself, with his
toga drawn over the back of his head, offering a libation; on
his right and on his left were the two Lares, like those represented
in paintings <a href="#Page_271">(p. 271</a>) and in the little bronze images so
often found in house shrines.</p>

<p>In connection with the Lares the members of a family honored
other gods, Penates, to whose special protection the head
of the household had committed himself and his interests. As
we shall see later, in house shrines diminutive bronze figures
representing Hercules, Mercury, Fortuna, and other divinities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
are often found together with those of the Lares. It is quite
possible that other gods were likewise associated with the Lares
of the city; and perhaps here in the two chapels at the sides of
the main room images of Ceres and of Bacchus were placed.
Regarding the statues that stood in the eight niches it is better
to refrain from conjecture. On the outside of the building, under
the portico of the Macellum, was a small platform (4), the raised
floor of which was reached by steps.</p>

<p>At the edge of the Forum in front of the building are eight
square blocks of basalt, which still have traces of the iron clamps
by which marble veneering was fastened on. These supported
the columns of a portico which was joined with the porticos of
the Macellum and the temple of Vespasian and took the place
of the Forum colonnade. As the main room of the building was
open to the sky, the portico also must have been without a roof;
there is no trace of any support for the ends of the rafters at the
rear. The columns in front, probably of two orders one above
the other, were merely for ornament. Possibly awnings were
at times stretched over the area of the portico as a protection
against sun and rain.

<h3>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE TEMPLE OF VESPASIAN</i></span></h3>

<p>South of the sanctuary of the City Lares is another religious
edifice of an entirely different character. Passing from the
Forum across the open space once occupied by the portico&mdash;of
which no remains have been found&mdash;we
enter a wide doorway and find ourselves in
a four-sided court somewhat irregular in
shape (<a href="#fig043">Fig. 43</a>). The front part is occupied
by a colonnade (1).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;"><a name="fig043" id="fig043"></a>

<li>2. Altar.</li>
<li>3. Temple.</li>
<li>4. Portico, forming part of the colonnade of the Forum.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>At the rear a small temple (3) stands upon
a high podium which projects in front of the
cella and reached by two flights of steps.
The pedestal for the image of the divinity
is built against the rear wall.</p>

<p>In the middle of the court is an altar
faced with marble and adorned on all four sides with reliefs of
moderately good workmanship. The sacrificial scene shown
in the accompanying illustration (<a href="#fig044">Fig. 44</a>) is on the front side,
facing the entrance to the court. A priest with a toga drawn
over his head in the manner prescribed for those offering sacrifice,
pours a libation from a shallow bowl, <i>patera</i>, upon an altar
having the form of a tripod. With him at the left are two lictors
with their bundles of rods, a fluteplayer, two boys, <i>camilli</i>,
carrying the utensils for the sacrifice, and an attendant; at
the right a bull intended for sacrifice is being brought to the
altar by the slayer, <i>victimarius</i>, and an assistant. In the background
is a tetrastyle temple, doubtless the temple before us;
the scene represents the dedicatory exercises. The middle intercolumniation
of the portico, as indicated by the relief and
shown in the plan, is wider than the other two.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>On the sides of the altar some of the utensils and ceremonial
objects used in sacrificing are represented: at the left the
napkin (<i>mantele</i>), the augural staff (<i>lituus</i>), and the box in which
the incense was kept (<i>acerra</i>); at the right the libation bowl
(<i>patera</i>), a ladle (<i>simpulum</i>), and a pitcher.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig044" id="fig044"></a>
<img src="images/fig044.jpg" width="537" height="418" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 44.&mdash;Front of the altar in the court of the temple of Vespasian.</p>
</div>

<p>The reliefs on the back of the altar, which consist simply of
a wreath of oak leaves with a conventional laurel on either side,
are of special significance and give a clew to the purpose of the
edifice. On the thirteenth of January, 27 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, the Senate voted
that a civic crown&mdash;that is, one made of oak leaves, of the kind
awarded to a soldier who had saved the life of a Roman citizen&mdash;should
be placed above the door of the house in which
Augustus lived, and that the doorposts should be wreathed with
laurel. From that time the civic crown and the laurel were recognized
as attributes denoting imperial rank. This temple, therefore,
was built in honor of an emperor. From the inscriptions
of the Arval Brethren, we learn that in the case of a living emperor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
a bull was the suitable victim, but that an ox was sacrificed
to an emperor who had been deified after death. As the
victim on our altar is a bull, the temple must have been dedicated
to an emperor during his lifetime. With these facts in
mind it will not be difficult to ascertain to whose worship the
building was consecrated.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig045" id="fig045"></a>
<img src="images/fig045.jpg" width="489" height="340" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 45.&mdash;View of the temple of Vespasian.</p>
</div>

<p>The coins of Augustus have both the civic crown and the
laurel, but those of his immediate successors have only the
former. In the year 74 the laurel again appears with the crown
on the coins of Vespasian and Titus, and we may suppose that
the distinction formerly conferred on Augustus was about this
time revived in honor of Vespasian. It was indeed quite natural
that men should think of Vespasian and Augustus together.
Both restored peace and order after disastrous civil wars; both
adopted severe repressive measures against luxury and immorality,
and both adorned Rome with great public buildings. The
temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline, which Augustus had repaired
and made more magnificent, Vespasian rebuilt from the
foundation after it was burned in 69.</p>

<p>The Senate, which had suffered so seriously at the hands of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Nero, had reason to be deeply grateful to Vespasian, who treated
it with marked respect, in this also following the example of
Augustus. If the annals of the reigns of the Flavian emperors
were not so meagre, we should very likely find a decree of the
Senate honoring Vespasian with the civic crown and the laurel.
Such a decree might well have suggested the founding of a
temple, and the placing of these symbols of peace and victory
upon its altar.</p>

<p>The temple itself was built, together with the court, after the
earthquake of 63, and at the time of the eruption the work was
not entirely completed. The walls of the cella and of the entrance
from the Forum had received their veneering of marble
and were in a finished state;
but those of the court, divided
off into a series of deep panels
above which small pediments
alternated with arches (<a href="#fig045">Fig.
45</a>), had received only a rough
coat of stucco and were still
awaiting completion. The
temple must have been built
in the time of Vespasian, who
reigned from 68 to 79 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>;
and as this emperor possessed
too great simplicity of character
to allow men to worship
him as a god while he was
still alive, it was probably
dedicated to his Genius.</p>

</div>

<p>The rooms at the rear of the
temple (shown on the plan)
were entered by a door at the right. They may have served as
a habitation for the sacristan, or as a place of storage for the
sacrificial utensils. The north room was also connected with
rooms belonging to the sanctuary of the Lares, the purpose of
which is unknown.

</ul>
</div>

<p>The plan of the large building on the east side of the Forum,
between the temple of Vespasian and Abbondanza Street, is
simple and regular. In front is a deep portico (1), facing the
Forum. The interior consists of a large oblong court with
three apses at the rear and a colonnade about the four sides (9);
on three sides there is a corridor behind the colonnade, with
numerous windows opening upon it (12). The corridor could be
entered by three doors, two at the front end of the court, connecting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
with the colonnade, and a third at the rear, entered from
the end of a passage leading up from Abbondanza Street (14),
the grade of which at this point is considerably below the pavement
of the building (<a href="#fig050">Fig. 50</a>).</p>

<p>An inscription appears in large letters on the entablature of
the portico, and again on a marble tablet over the side entrance
in Abbondanza Street: <i>Eumachia L. f., sacerd[os] publ[ica],
nomine suo et M. Numistri Frontonis fili chalcidicum, cryptam,
porticus Concordiae Augustae Pietati sua pequnia fecit eademque
dedicavit</i>,&mdash;'Eumachia, daughter of Lucius Eumachius, a city
priestess, in her own name and that of her son, Marcus Numistrius
Fronto, built at her own expense the portico, the corridor
(<i>cryptam</i>, covered passage), and the colonnade, dedicating them
to Concordia Augusta and Pietas.'</p>

<p>The word <i>pietas</i>, in such connections, has no English equivalent,
and is difficult to translate. It sums up in a single concept
the qualities of filial affection, conscientious devotion, and obedience
to duty which in the Roman view characterized the
proper conduct of children toward their parents and grandparents.
Here mother and son united in dedicating the building
to personifications, or deifications, of the perfect harmony
and the regard for elders that prevailed in the imperial family.</p>

<p>The reference of the dedication can only be to the relation
between the Emperor Tiberius and his mother Livia; it cannot
apply to Nero and Agrippina, for the reason that the walls of
the building were decorated in the third Pompeian style, which
in Nero's time was no longer in vogue. In 22 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>, when Livia
was very ill, the Senate voted to erect an altar to Pietas
Augusta. In the following year Drusus, the son of Tiberius,
gave expression to his regard for his grandmother by placing
her likeness upon his coins, with the word Pietas.</p>

<p>On the coins of colonies also&mdash;of Saragossa and another the
name of which is not known&mdash;the Pietas Augusta appears, apparently
about the same time. Not long afterwards the harmonious
relations between Tiberius and his mother gave place
to mutual suspicion and hostility; the dedication therefore
points to the earlier part of the reign of Tiberius, and in this
period the building was no doubt erected. The statue of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
Concordia Augusta, a female figure with a gilded cornucopia,
was found in the building; the head, which has not been preserved,
probably bore the features of Livia. By this dedication
the building of Eumachia, as the Macellum later, was placed
under the protection of the imperial house.</p>

<p>While the parts are enumerated in the dedicatory inscription,
neither the name of the building as a whole, nor the purpose, is
mentioned. A hint of the latter, however, is found in another
inscription. A broad niche (13) opens into the corridor at the
rear, directly behind the largest apse. Here stood a marble
statue of a beautiful woman (<a href="#fig255">Fig. 255</a>), now replaced by a
cast; the original is in Naples. Upon the pedestal we read:
<i>Eumachiae L. f., sacerd[oti] publ[icae], fullones</i>,&mdash;'Dedicated
to Eumachia, daughter of Lucius Eumachius, a city priestess,
by the fullers.'</p>

<p>This building, in which the fullers had set up, in a specially
prominent place, a statue of the person who had erected it,
must in some way have served the purposes of their trade.
Clearly enough it was not a fullery; on the other hand, it was
well adapted for a clothier's exchange, a bazaar for the sale of
cloth and articles of clothing. Tables and other furniture for
the convenience of dealers could be placed in the colonnade and
the corridor; in the corridor, especially, goods exposed for sale in
front of the open windows could be conveniently inspected by
prospective buyers,&mdash;not only by those in the corridor itself,
but also by those looking in from the colonnade. The small
doors between the corridor and the colonnade could be securely
closed, and the entrance from Abbondanza Street could be
easily guarded; there was only a narrow door at the end
of the passage opening into the corridor, and at the street
entrance was a porter's room connected by doors both with
the passage and with the street. This evidence of unusual
precaution suggests that possibly the side entrance, from its
close connection with the corridor, was intended especially for
the conveyance of goods to and from the building, in order
that the front entrance might be left for the exclusive use of
purchasers and dealers.</p>

<p>On the assumption that the building was a cloth market, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
clear that the colonnade would naturally be open at all times,
the corridor only during business hours; after business hours
the corridor would be closed for the protection of the goods left
there over night. The windows may have been closed with
shutters as in the Oriental bazaars. Other peculiarities of arrangement
also are cleared up by this explanation, but we
cannot present them in detail. It is not possible, however, to
make out what the purpose was of certain remains of masonry
found on the south side of the court (18) which have now disappeared,
or of two rectangular elevations at the rear (17), or,
finally, of a large stone in the middle of the court in which
a movable iron ring is fastened (15). Our information is so
scanty that we are unable to determine in all particulars what
the requirements of a fuller's exchange might have been.</p>

<p>At the time of the eruption men were still engaged in rebuilding
the parts of the edifice that had suffered in the earthquake
of 63. The front wall at the rear of the portico was finished
and had received its veneering of marble; as shown by the
existing remains, it conformed to the plan of the earlier structure.
The columns and entablature of the portico had not yet been
set in place; considerable portions of them were found in the
area of the Forum. The wall at the rear of the court, with the
three apses, had been rebuilt, and the workmen had begun to
add the marble covering. The other walls had remained standing
at the time of the earthquake; but the colonnade had been
thrown down and was now in process of erection. The remains
of the colonnade were removed in ancient times, probably soon
after the destruction of the city; yet from the parts that remain,
both of the old building and of the restorations, we can determine
the architectural character with certainty. We give two reconstructions
of the interior, one showing the front (<a href="#fig048">Fig. 48</a>), the
other the rear (<a href="#fig049">Fig. 49</a>).</p>

<p>The colonnade and the portico were characterized by the
same peculiarity of construction: they were in two stories, one
above the other, but there was no upper floor corresponding
with the intermediate entablature. In the case of the portico
this is certain from the treatment of the wall at the rear, the
ornamentation of which is carried without interruption high
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
above the level of the entablature. If the appearance of this
building alone had been taken into account, it would have been
simpler and more effective to place at the front of the portico a
single order of large columns the height of which should correspond
with that of the façade; but as the colonnade about the
Forum was in two stories, the front of the portico was made to
conform to it. The columns below were of the Doric, those
above of the Ionic, order. The material&mdash;whitish limestone&mdash;was
the same as that used in the new colonnade of the Forum.
Nevertheless, by the skilful handling of details a certain individuality
was given to the columns; while in general appearance
they harmonized with those about the Forum, the portico as a
whole stood out by itself as something distinct and characteristic.</p>

<p>The columns of the portico were left unfluted, as were those
of the new Forum colonnade, and were of the same height; but
their proportions were
more slender, their
ornamental forms
were slightly different,
and they were
set closer together.
The pains and skill
manifested in harmonizing
the particular
with the general
architectural effect reflect
much credit upon
the Pompeian board
of public works. Under the portico at the foot of each column
was a statue, facing the front of the building; the pedestals,
which still remain, assist in determining the places of the columns,
of which only one was found in position. The spaces between
the columns could be closed by latticed gates, as may be
seen from traces of them remaining in the marble pavement
at the south end of the portico; the pavement elsewhere has
disappeared.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 48.&mdash;The building of Eumachia: front of the
court, restored.</p>
</div>

<p>The wall at the rear of the portico, facing the Forum, was
richly ornamented. The broad entrance in the middle (6) was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
bridged at the top by a lintel. At the ends are two large niches
more than four feet above the pavement (5), both reached by
flights of steps. Between each of these and the doorway is a
large apsidal arched niche (4) extending down to the pavement.
Lastly in the projecting portions of the wall are four smaller
niches for statues. The whole façade was overlaid with various
kinds of colored marbles.</p>

<p>None of the statues have been found, but the inscriptions
belonging to the two that stood in the small niches at the left
are extant and of special interest; the names of the persons
represented, Aeneas and Romulus, are given, together with a
short enumeration of their heroic deeds. These statues were
evidently copies; the originals formed a part of a famous series
in Rome.</p>

<p>Augustus set up in his Forum the statues of renowned Roman
generals with inscriptions setting forth their services to the
State; in this way, he said, the people might obtain a standard
of comparison for himself and his successors. At the beginning
of the series were Aeneas, the kings of Alba Longa, and Romulus.
Not one of these statues has been preserved, but some
of the inscriptions have been found in Rome, while others are
known from copies discovered in Arezzo, where without doubt,
as at Pompeii, they were set up with copies of the statues&mdash;a
forcible illustration of the striving of the smaller cities to be like
Rome. Two other statues, perhaps representing Julius Caesar
and Augustus, stood in the niches at the right corresponding
with those of Aeneas and Romulus; it is not probable that the
rest of the series in Rome was duplicated here, because the
remaining pedestals in the portico were all designed for figures
of larger size.</p>

<p>The colonnade about the court was of marble. The front
part, as one entered from the portico, was higher than that on
the sides and rear (<a href="#fig048">Fig. 48</a>); it must have presented a fine
architectural effect. The two series of Corinthian columns, one
above the other, reached the height of 30 feet; the wall behind
was diversified with niches and completely covered with
marble. At the right and at the left one could pass down the
sides under the colonnade, or through small doors into the corridor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
The walls between the colonnade and the corridor,
pierced with large windows, were decorated below with a dado
of colored marbles and above with painting upon stucco, in
the third style.</p>

<p>The two smaller apsidal niches at the rear were no higher
than the colonnade, but the central apse projected above and
terminated in a marble pediment (<a href="#fig049">Fig. 49</a>), fragments of which
are still to be seen in the building. It was entered through
three arched doorways, above which apparently there were
windows. The image of Concordia Augusta, with the features
of Livia, probably stood on the pedestal at the rear of the apse,
while the statues of Tiberius and Drusus may have adorned the
niches at the sides.</p>

</div>

<p>We can readily see why the colonnade was made so high,
and in two stories, when a lower structure would have afforded
better protection against sun and rain. Had it been limited to
the usual height the
corridor behind it
would have been too
dark; and if instead
of a double series of
small columns, one
above the other, there
had been a single series
of large columns
of the usual proportions,
the thickness of
the latter would have
shut out much light
and have made the colonnade seem less roomy. The arrangement
adopted had the further advantage that it harmonized
the aspect of the colonnade with that of the portico, the character
of which, as we have seen, was determined by that of the
colonnade about the Forum.</p>

<p>The small rooms of irregular shape at the sides of the apse
(11) were light courts, left open to the sky in order to furnish
light to the corridor at the rear, which was shut off from the
colonnade.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>The corridor was about fourteen feet in height; its walls still
have remains of decoration in the third style.</p>

<p>At the right of the broad niche (13), in which the statue of
Eumachia was found, a door opened into the passage leading
from Abbondanza Street; in the corresponding position at the
left, where there was no entrance, a door was painted upon the
wall. This is a folding door in three parts, of a kind quite
common at Pompeii; the middle part is hung by means of hinges,
like those on doors of the present day, fastened to one of the
leaves at the sides, while these are represented as swinging on
pivots at the top and the bottom.</p>

<p>A stairway at the southeast corner of the corridor, over the
entrance from Abbondanza Street, led to an upper room. A
similar stairway was placed in the last of the little rooms between
the court and the portico, at the left of the front entrance.
The upper rooms, difficult to reach, could hardly have been
intended for salesrooms. They must have been low, probably
no higher than the difference between the height of the colonnade
and that of the corridor. They were most likely used as
temporary storerooms for the goods of the dealers.</p>

In the background, steps in the side entrance of the Eumachia building.</p>
</div>

<p>In front of the entrance from Abbondanza Street, is a fountain
of the ordinary Pompeian form; as the material is limestone
it is probably of later date than the other fountains, which
are generally of basalt. As may be seen in our illustration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
(<a href="#fig050">Fig. 50</a>), the inlet pipe was carried by a broad standard projecting
above the edge of the basin, on the front of which a
bust of a female figure with a cornucopia is carved in relief.
The right side of the face has been worn away by eager drinkers
pressing their mouths against the mouth of the figure,
whence the jet issued; it reminds one of the attenuated right
foot of the famous bronze St. Peter in Rome. Hands also have
worn deep, polished hollows in the stone on either side of the
standard. The figure represents Concordia Augusta, but the
name Abundantia, given to it when first discovered, still lingers
in the Italian name for the street, which might more appropriately
have been called Strada della Concordia.

<h3>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE COMITIUM</i></span></h3>

<p>The last building on the east side of the Forum, south of
Abbondanza Street, had undergone a complete transformation a
short time before the destruction of the city. Before the rebuilding,
a row of pillars separated the interior of
the structure from the Forum and from the
street. At the edge of the sidewalk along
the latter are square holes opposite the pillars
(shown on the plan, <a href="#fig051">Fig. 51</a>), evidently
designed for the insertion of posts, so that a
temporary barrier of some sort could be set
up. The end of the space within the barrier
where this came to the Forum, and of the rest
of the street as well, could be shut off by latticed
gates.</p>

<div class="figright"><a name="fig051" id="fig051"></a>

</p>
<ul class="cap-list">
<li>1. Recess opening on the
main room.</li>
<li>2. Recess opening on the
Forum.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>If the barrier were set up, and the latticed
gate at the Forum end left open, the building
and the space within the barrier would be shut off from
Abbondanza Street, but closely connected with the Forum by
the numerous entrances. After the rebuilding only two
entrances from the Forum were left, and one from Abbondanza
Street.</p>

<p>It is altogether unlikely that so large a building, of irregular
shape and with pillars on two sides, was provided with a roof;
we have here an open space rather, serving as an extension of
the Forum. The walls were covered with marble and adorned
with niches, in which, without doubt, statues were placed. On
the south side is a large recess the floor of which, reached by a
flight of steps, forms a kind of platform or tribune about four
feet above the pavement of the enclosure (1). A small door at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
the right leads into a narrow room containing a similar platform
opening on the colonnade of the Forum (2), and to all appearances
once accessible from it by steps; afterwards both the
steps and the tribune were walled up.</p>

<p>The purpose of these tribunes, and of the building as a whole,
is far from clear. An analogy, however, suggests itself. On
one side of the Roman Forum near the upper end was a small
rectangular open space called the Comitium, used in early
times as a voting place. Between the Forum and the Comitium
was originally a speaker's platform, the Rostra, so placed that
orators by turning toward one side could address an audience
in the Comitium and facing about could harangue the Forum.
Though the later changes have obscured the original form of
our building, yet it is plain that at one time there must have
been two connected tribunes, one facing the Forum, the other
the enclosed open space; we may at least hazard the conjecture
that the colonists of Sulla, taking the arrangements of the
capital as their pattern in all things, designed this place as
their Comitium.</p>

<p>The enclosure was too small to admit of its use for voting
according to the ancient fashion, but general elections in the
Comitium had long been a thing of the past; only the unimportant
curiate elections were held there, at which each curia
was represented by a lictor, and at other times the place was
used for judicial proceedings. So our building was probably
used, if not for elections, for formalities preliminary to the
elections and for business connected with the courts.

<h3>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS</i></span></h3>

<p>At the south end of the Forum were three buildings similar
in plan and closely connected. In front they presented a common
façade, the narrow spaces between them being entered
by low doors. The building at the right (<a href="#fig052">Fig. 52</a>, 3) was at the
corner of the Forum, while the space separating the other two
lay on a line dividing the Forum into two equal parts; east of
the last building is the Strada delle Scuole.</p>

<div class="figright"><a name="fig052" id="fig052"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 52.&mdash;Plan of the Municipal
Buildings.<br />
<a href="images/fig052fs.jpg">View larger image</a></p>

<ul class="cap-list">
<li>1. Office of the duumvirs.</li>
<li>2. Hall of the city council.</li>
<li>3. Office of the aediles.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The three buildings were erected after the earthquake of
63, on the site of older buildings of the same character. In
the walls of that furthest east (1), considerable
remains of the earlier walls are
embodied; in that near the corner the
original pavement is preserved, and in
the middle building there are traces of the
original pavement. Previous to this rebuilding
the inner series of columns belonging
to the colonnade about the Forum
had in part been removed and a barrier set
up, by which the space in front of the middle
building and that at the left could be shut off (indicated
on the plan by broken lines). At the time of the eruption only
the building at the left (1) was entirely finished. The others
still lacked their decoration on both inner and outer walls.</p>

<p>These three spacious halls must have served the purposes of
the city administration. The two at the right and the left are
alike in having at the end opposite the entrance an apse large
enough to accommodate one or more magistrates with their
attendants; they were the official quarters of the aediles and
the duumvirs, while the middle hall was the council chamber,
<i>curia</i>, where the decurions met.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>

<p>The middle room was obviously intended to be the most
richly ornamented of the three, and was further distinguished
from the others by the elevation of its floor, which was more
than two feet above the pavement of the colonnade. In front
of the entrance is a platform reached at either end by an
approach hardly wide enough for two persons, thus suited for
a select rather than a large attendance.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig053" id="fig053"></a>
<img src="images/fig053.jpg" width="532" height="257" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 53.&mdash;View of the south end of the Forum.<br />

In the background, the ruins of the municipal buildings; in front of these, the remains of
the colonnade. In the middle ground the pedestals of the statues of the imperial family.</p>
</div>

<p>Along the sides within runs a ledge a little more than five
feet above the floor, on which rested a double series of columns,
one above the other, serving both as ornament and as
a support for a ceiling like that of the temple of Jupiter.
If we picture to ourselves the columns in place, the walls covered
with marble, and a rich coffered ceiling above, we are led
to form a favorable idea of the recuperative powers of the city
which set about the construction of such costly and splendid
buildings so soon after the terrible earthquake.</p>

<p>The recess at the rear was designed for a large shrine patterned
after the small shrines of the Lares and Penates in
private houses. The Penates of the city were above all the
emperor and his family. If this shrine had been finished, figures
representing Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian would probably
have been placed in it, facing the three Capitoline divinities
in the temple of Jupiter at the other end of the Forum.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span></p>

<p>The office of the aediles, situated at the corner of the colonnade
and close to the Basilica, and with no barrier to prevent
ready access, was particularly convenient for magistrates who,
among other duties, were charged with the maintenance of
order and the enforcement of regulations in the markets. One
or perhaps both aediles sat in the apse; while the rear and
middle parts of the room were reserved for those who had
business with them. The front part, lower than the rest by two
steps (shown on the plan), may have served as a waiting room.
At the rear of the apse and in the walls at the sides were niches
for the statues of members of the imperial family and of those
who had rendered important services to the city.</p>

<p>As the duumvirs not only sat as judges but also had in their
hands the financial administration of the city, we can see why
the hall set aside for their use was the first to be rebuilt after
the earthquake. The magistrates, of course, sat in the apse,
along the wall of which was a ledge for statues. The strong
front doors were fastened with iron bolts, and there was also
a latticed gate on the step in front of the threshold; probably
the archives of the duumviral office were kept within. The
small side door at the right made it possible to enter and leave
the building after business hours or at other times when the
large doors were closed.

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE TEMPLE OF VENUS POMPEIANA</i></span></h3>

<p>For some years it had been known that a temple once stood
in the rectangular block south of the strada della Marina; and
in 1898 workmen excavating here began to uncover the massive
foundations. When the volcanic deposits had been removed it
was seen that the court of the temple, with the surrounding colonnade,
occupied the whole area between the Basilica and the
west wall of the long room now used as a Museum. On the
podium (<a href="#fig055">Fig. 55</a>) was found a part of a statuette of Venus, of
the familiar type which represents the goddess as preparing to
enter the bath; it was probably a votive offering set up by some
worshipper. In the subterranean passageway entered near the
southeast corner (<a href="#fig054"></a>, IV) the excavators found another
votive offering, a bronze steering paddle of the kind shown in
paintings as an attribute of Venus Pompeiana; an example may
be seen in Fig. 4 (<a href="#Page_12">p. 12</a>). From these indications, as well as
from the size of the temple and its location, near the Forum and
on an elevation commanding a wide view of the sea, we are safe
in assigning the sanctuary to Venus Pompeiana, the patron
divinity of Roman Pompeii.</p>

<p>Prior to the founding of the Roman colony the site of the
temple had been occupied by houses, built in several stories on
the edge of the hill, which here slopes sharply toward the southwest;
remains of the houses, which must have resembled those
farther east (an example is the house of the Emperor Joseph II,
<a href="#Page_344">p. 344</a>), have been brought to light in the course of the excavations.
In less than a century and a half the temple was twice
built, twice destroyed; a third building was in progress at the
time of the eruption.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p>The first temple was erected in the early years of the Roman
colony. An area approximately 185 Roman feet square was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
prepared for it by levelling off and filling up, terrace walls being
built to hold in place the earth and rubbish used for filling. The
foundations of the walls about the court (A-B, C-D-E) can still
be traced except on the south side, where, perhaps in consequence
of the earthquake at the time of the eruption, every
vestige has disappeared, and at the southwest corner, where
excavations for building materials in modern times have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
carried below the Roman level, a part of the foundation of the
temple itself having been removed. These walls conformed to
the direction of the walls of the Basilica, the corners, as those
of the Basilica, showing a noticeable divergence from a right
angle.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig055" id="fig055"></a>
<img src="images/fig055.jpg" width="535" height="430" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 55.&mdash;Ruins of the temple of Venus Pompeiana, viewed from the southeast.<br />

At the right, foundation of the front row of columns of the latest (unfinished) colonnade; then foundation
of stylobate of earlier colonnade, with gutter. In foreground, entrance to subterranean passage.
On the podium of the temple at the farther end is seen the pedestal of the statue of the
divinity. The wall at the rear of the court is on the south side of the strada della Marina.</p>
</div>

<p>The front of the earlier colonnade is outlined by the gutter
(F-G-G', G"-H-I), constructed of blocks of tufa, which show
signs of long use, and the foundation of the stylobate behind the
gutter, which is plainly seen (<a href="#fig055">Fig. 55</a>); in places (as indicated
in the plan), the layer of mortar spread over this foundation
shows the impressions made by the blocks of the stylobate which
rested on it. At the middle of the north side (G'-G") both the
gutter and the wall under the stylobate were removed when the
foundations of the third temple were extended in that direction.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Along the gutter were basins for water used in cleaning the floor
of the court, which was made of fine concrete. The entrance to
the court was at the northeast corner.</p>

<p>On the east side of the court were six rooms, the rear of which
was formed by the wall A'B'. Two of these opened on the
colonnade in their whole breadth, and four with narrow doors,
the thresholds of which, of whitish limestone, are still in place.
Their purpose cannot be determined. The cross walls shown
in the plan on the west side (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>) belonged to an earlier building,
and have nothing to do with the temple.</p>

<p>In front of the temple are remains of a large altar of whitish
limestone (III). On the east side of the court is the base of
an equestrian statue (V), of the same material, which was afterwards
veneered with marble; near it is a pedestal of a standing
figure (VI), of masonry covered with stucco, and behind this is
the small base of a fountain figure. Near the southeast corner
is the entrance (IV) to a subterranean passageway which runs
toward the south; it probably led to rooms of earlier houses
which were preserved, when the area was filled up, for the use
of the attendants of the temple.</p>

<p>The temple itself, as the other edifices, religious and secular,
of the first years of the Roman colony, must have been built of
common materials and coated with stucco. Of the existing remains
only the inner part of the podium (I, II on the Plan) can
be assigned to it; a series of small blocks of tufa at the rear end
is perhaps a remnant of the cornice which was carried around
the upper edge of the podium.</p>

<p>To the Pompeians of the Empire the modest structure of
Republican days seemed unworthy of the tutelary divinity of
their city. On the same podium they built a temple of marble.
Of this are preserved the foundations of the door posts of the
cella (<a href="#fig056">Fig. 56</a> <i>a</i>) and the core of the pedestal (D) on which stood
the statue of the divinity, besides some bits of the cella floor,
which consisted of a border of white mosaic (<i>b</i>), a broad strip of
pavement of small flags of colored marble (<i>c</i>), and an ornamental
centre (<i>a</i>) now entirely destroyed. The only remains of the
superstructure that can be identified are in a storeroom north of
the temple of Apollo. They consist of fragments of large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
marble columns, nearly thirty-two inches in diameter, and of an
entablature of corresponding dimensions.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p>After the completion of the temple the Pompeians set about
rebuilding the colonnade, on a scale of equal magnificence.
First of all they enlarged the court by removing the old walls
to the foundations,
and constructed
new outside walls
(<i>a-b-c-d</i>), the corners
of which form
right angles. The
wall on the north
side, of reticulate
work, can be distinguished
in <a href="#fig055">Fig. 55</a>.
That on the east
side is also well
preserved, but of
that on the south
side no trace remains. The deep foundation of the wall on
the west side forms the farther wall of the present Museum, the
roof of which very nearly represents the level of the floor of the
ancient court. The colonnade was to be single on the north,
double on the east and west sides. The principal entrance
was at the northeast corner (K), with a smaller entrance (L)
at the end of the narrow street south of the Basilica.</p>

<p>How far the work had progressed before the earthquake of the
year 63 it is not easy to determine. The new gutter along the
front of the colonnade had not yet been laid, but the foundations
of the rows of columns (<i>e</i>-<i>f</i>-<i>g</i>-<i>h</i>, <i>e'f'</i>, <i>g'h'</i>) were for the most
part ready. From the Corinthian capital and fragments of
shafts and entablature lying about the court it is clear that these
members were fitted and in place when they were thrown down.
Part of the colonnade was therefore finished. It was in two
stories, probably without an intervening floor, like the porticoes
in front of the Macellum and the building of Eumachia. Not less
than three hundred marble columns must have been required to
complete the work; undoubtedly the wall back of the colonnade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
was divided off by pilasters below and half columns above, the
intervening spaces being filled with marble. In point of size,
the temple with its court formed the largest sanctuary, in richness
of materials the most splendid edifice of the entire city.</p>

<p>The great earthquake felled to the ground alike the finished
temple and the unfinished colonnade. But the Pompeians, in
their time of trouble least of all disposed, we may assume, to
forsake their patron goddess, soon commenced the work of
rebuilding. Postponing the renewal and completion of the colonnade
as of secondary importance, they cleared away the débris
of the temple, and on the podium where the cella had stood
constructed a temporary place of worship, a small wooden building
strengthened at the bottom by a low wall around the outside.
Then they proceeded to enlarge the podium; the third temple
was to be even more imposing than its predecessor. The old
steps were removed from the front. The existing podium was
cut back five Roman feet on each side, and four inches at the
rear, to form the core of the new podium; on all sides of this
a massive foundation wall was commenced, five and a half Roman
feet thick, made of large blocks of basalt carefully worked and
fitted. A similar wall was carried through the old podium (<span class="s08">B&mdash;B'</span>),
to serve as the foundation for the front wall of the cella. The
relative size of the component parts of the new temple is thus
clearly indicated. The cella was to extend over the space
<span class="s08">B&mdash;C&mdash;C'&mdash;B'</span>, the portico over that marked <span class="s08">A&mdash;B&mdash;B'</span>; how far the
steps were to project in front is uncertain.</p>

<p>At the time of the eruption five courses of basalt had been
laid, reaching a height of more than four feet, the space between
the core of the old podium and the outer wall being filled with
concrete as the work progressed. On the north side of the court
are still to be seen a number of blocks of basalt not yet trimmed
and fitted, just as they were abandoned by the workmen when
the work was stopped forever.

<h3>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE TEMPLE OF FORTUNA AUGUSTA</i></span></h3>

<p>Passing out from the Forum under the arch at the northeast
corner, we enter the broadest street in Pompeii. On the right
a colonnade over the sidewalk runs along the front of the
first block, at the
further corner of
which, where Forum
Street opens
into Nola Street,
stands the small
temple of Fortuna
Augusta. The
front of the temple
is in a line with
the colonnade,
which seems to
have been designed as a continuation of the colonnade about
the Forum; the builders apparently wished to have it appear
that the temple was located on an extension of the Forum rather
than on a street. The colonnade is certainly not older than the
earlier years of the Empire, and the temple dates from the time
of Augustus.</p>

<p>The divinity of the temple and the name of its builder are
both known to us from an inscription on the architrave of the
shrine at the rear of the cella: <i>M. Tullius M. f., d. v. i. d. ter.,

time, quinquennial duumvir, augur, and military tribune by the
choice of the people, (erected this) temple to Fortuna Augusta
on his own ground and at his own expense.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<p>Such inscriptions were ordinarily placed on the entablature
of the portico. The portico of this temple, however, had been
thrown down by the earthquake of 63, and had not yet been
rebuilt. The cella may have been damaged also, but in order
that the worship might not be interrupted the shrine was restored;
the inscription was temporarily placed over it.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 58.&mdash;Temple of Fortuna Augusta, restored.</p>
</div>

<p>The remains of the walls, columns, and entablature make it
possible to reconstruct the edifice with certainty (<a href="#fig058">Fig. 58</a>). The
plan (<a href="#fig057">Fig. 57</a>) in several respects closely resembles that of the
temple of Jupiter, from which the architect copied the projecting
platform in front of the podium, with its altar and double
series of steps. The eight columns sustaining the portico had
Corinthian capitals. The walls of the cella were veneered with
marble. In the shrine at the rear stood, without doubt, the
image of Fortuna as guardian of the fortunes of Augustus and
protectress of the imperial family (<a href="#fig059">Fig. 59</a>).</p>

<p>There were also in the walls of the cella four niches for
statues, of which two have been found. The face of one, a
female figure, had been sawed off in order to replace it with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
another, which has not come to light; the features of the other
statue were said in the reports of the excavations to resemble
those of Cicero, but the resemblance is purely fanciful, suggested
by the name Marcus Tullius in the dedicatory inscription.
Both statues
were of persons connected
with the priesthood,
not of members
of the imperial family.
Probably statues of
the latter were set up
elsewhere, so that the
cella was left free for
less important personages.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 59.&mdash;Rear of the cella in the temple of Fortuna Augusta,

</div>

<p>The worship of
Fortuna Augusta was
in charge of a college
of priests, consisting
of four slaves and
freedmen, who were
called <i>Ministri
Fortunae Augustae</i>,&mdash;'Servants
of Fortuna
Augusta.' Our information
in regard to them is derived from five inscriptions, of
which two were found in the temple, the others in different
places; but none of them where they originally belonged.
These all relate to the small statues, <i>signa</i>, of which one was
set up by the college every year. One inscription, of the year
3 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, speaks of the 'first servants (<i>ministri primi</i>) of Fortuna
Augusta.' The priesthood was therefore established in that year,
and the temple was probably built only a short time before.</p>

<p>In donating the land for the temple Tullius retained the
ownership of a narrow strip of irregular shape at the right.
Here a rough block of basalt was set up with the inscription:
<i>M. Tulli M. f. area privata</i>,&mdash;'Private property belonging to
Marcus Tullius, son of Marcus.'</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX<br />

<span class="s08"><i>GENERAL VIEW OF THE PUBLIC BUILDINGS NEAR THE
STABIAN GATE&mdash;THE FORUM TRIANGULARE AND THE
DORIC TEMPLE</i></span></h3>

<p>The end of the old lava stream on which Pompeii lay runs
off into two points; in the depression between them, as we
have seen, was the Stabian Gate. On the edge of the spur at
the left a temple of the Doric style was built in very early
times. The descent here, toward the southwest, is so sharp
and the height so great that it was not necessary to add a
wall at the top as a means of defence.</p>

<p>The sides of the temple followed in general the direction of
the edge of the cliff. Raised upon a high foundation, it not
only dominated the plain below but was visible also from the
greater part of the city; glistening in the sun, it became a
landmark for mariners far out at sea, who from a distance
could offer greetings to the gods there enshrined.</p>

<p>In the second century <span class="s08">B.C.</span> the northwest corner of the
depression back of the Stabian Gate was selected as the site
for a large theatre (E on <a href="#plan3">Plan III</a>); previously, we may suppose,
temporary wooden structures had answered the purpose.
This location was chosen, in accordance with the Greek custom,
because the places for the greater part of the seats for the
spectators could be easily cut in the natural slope, which here
had the shape of half a shallow saucer; a superstructure was
necessary only for the upper rows of seats. The architect, if
not a Greek, was certainly of Greek training.</p>

<p>South of the theatre an extensive colonnade (G) was erected.
It was intended as a shelter for theatre-goers, but was afterwards
turned into barracks for gladiators.</p>

<p>With a similar purpose, a colonnade of the Doric order
was built along two sides of the triangular level space about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
the Greek temple (1). In front of the north end, where the
two arms of the colonnade meet, a high portico of the Ionic
order was erected (A) facing the street, thus forming a monumental
entrance to the Theatre. The southwest side of
the area was left unobstructed, and the place, by reason of
its shape, is called the Forum Triangulare, 'Three-cornered
Forum.'</p>

<p>In connection with the building of the Theatre land had been
expropriated and cleared as far north as the first east and west
street. Here, near the entrance of the Forum Triangulare, a
Palaestra for gymnastic exercises (C) was built, with funds left
for public purposes by a benevolent citizen. Later, probably
not before the time of the Roman colony, a temple of Isis (I)
was erected, adjoining the Theatre on the northeast.</p>

<p>Early in the Roman Period, not long after 80 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, a small
roofed theatre (F) was constructed east of the stage of the
Large Theatre and of the area at the rear.</p>

<p>Stabian Street north and south of the Small Theatre was
lined with private houses. At the northeast corner of the block
was a temple of Zeus Milichius (H), seemingly of early date,
but entirely rebuilt about the time that the Small Theatre was
erected.</p>

<p class="p2">Part of the columns and entablature belonging to the beautiful
portico at the entrance of the Forum Triangulare have
been set up again and are seen in our illustration (<a href="#fig060">Fig. 60</a>).
The brackets projecting from the rear wall were probably
designed for statuettes or vases. When the wall was rebuilt,
after the earthquake of 63, a change was made in at least one
particular. The small doorway at the middle, now at right
angles with the wall, formerly passed obliquely through it,
opening toward the end of the promenade which was laid out
in front of the colonnade at the left. This promenade (2 on
<a href="#plan3">Plan III</a>) was separated from the area of the Forum by a low
wall; on sunny winter days it must have been the most frequented
walk in the city.</p>

<p class="caption">PLATE III.&mdash;THE GREEK TEMPLE AND THE FORUM TRIANGULARE,
SEEN FROM THE SOUTH. RESTORATION BY WEICHARDT</p>
</div>

<p>Besides the small doorway, which was closed by a latticed
gate hung from a wooden jamb, there was at the left a massive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
double door with strong bolts, inside of which was still a second
door. It seems odd that one entrance should be so securely
closed, while the fastenings of the other were so light. Ordinarily,
the large doors must have been kept shut, while the
small entrance was left open for everyday use; but when there
was to be a play in the Theatre, and the magistrate who gave
the entertainment proceeded from the Forum with a retinue in
festal attire, then the great doors were swung back in honor of
the occasion, and the opening of them formed part of an impressive
ceremony.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig060" id="fig060"></a>
<img src="images/fig060.jpg" width="407" height="356" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 60.&mdash;Portico at the entrance of the Forum Triangulare.</p>
</div>

<p>The colonnade within contained ninety-five Doric columns.
It was only one story in height, and the columns for this reason
are more slender than those of the same order in the Forum.
The entablature varies from the Doric type only in respect to
the architrave, which consists of two bands. The continuation
of the colonnade along the southwest side was prevented by
the nearness of the temple to the edge of the cliff. Here
the magnificent view over the plain to the mountains and
across the Bay was unimpeded; for the enjoyment of it, two
duumvirs in the early years of the Empire built near the west
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
corner of the temple a semicircular stone seat, <i>schola</i> (4 on <a href="#plan3">Plan
III</a>), like those found in connection with tombs. On the back
they placed a sundial with the inscription: <i>L. Sepunius L. f.
Sandilianus, M. Herennius A. f. Epidianus duo vir[i] i. d.
scol[am] et horol[ogium] d. s. p. f. c.</i> (for <i>de sua pecunia faciundum
curarunt</i>),&mdash;'Lucius Sepunius Sandilianus the son of
Lucius, and Marcus Herennius Epidianus the son of Aulus,
duumvirs with judiciary authority, caused the seat and the sundial
to be made at their own expense.' The same duumvirs, as we
have seen, set up a sundial in the court of the temple of Apollo.</p>

At the left, remains of the Doric temple and of the altars and well house in front of it; at
the right, exterior of the large theatre.</p>
</div>

<p>At the foot of the middle column at the north end of the colonnade
is a broad basin of Carrara marble resting on a finely
proportioned, fluted standard; a jet of water fell into it from
the end of a pipe which passed through the column above. A
little further forward is a pedestal (8) veneered with marble on
which is the inscription: <i>M. Claudio C. f. Marcello patrono</i>,&mdash;'To
Marcus Claudius Marcellus, the son of Gaius, patron.' Here
stood a statue of Marcellus, the nephew of Augustus, a portrait
statue of whom we have already found in the imperial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
chapel of the Macellum. The reason why he was honored with
more than one statue is clear from the inscription before us: he
was patron of the colony.</p>

<p>The surface of the Forum Triangulare was considerably higher
than the top of the city wall (K) south of the barracks of the
Gladiators. It seems likely that a flight of steps led down to
the wall between the barracks and the long colonnade, as seen in
Weichardt's restoration (<a href="#plate03">Plate III</a>). This explanation accounts
for the existence of certain remains of walls (L on the plan),
the purpose of which is otherwise obscure.</p>

<p class="p2">Of the ancient Doric temple but little remains: only the foundation,
which was high for a Greek temple, with a flight of steps
in front; two stumps of columns and traces of a third; four capitals,
and portions of the right wall of the cella. The plan of
the cella, however, has been traced by means of excavations.</p>

<div class="figright"><a name="fig062" id="fig062"></a>

<li>5. Sepulchral enclosure.</li>
<li>6. Altars.</li>
<li>7. Well house.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The foundation, unlike the podiums of the other temples at
Pompeii, was built up in a series of broad, high steps. The
number of the columns, eleven on the
sides and seven in front, as in the temple
of Zeus at Agrigentum, has been
calculated from the distances between
the stumps. Of those in front two
were opposite the corners of the cella,
where the edges of the flight of steps
come to the stylobate (<a href="#fig062">Fig. 62</a>). Only
a narrow space was needed between the
walls of the cella and the surrounding
columns, but in order to make the outward
appearance more imposing the columns
were set as far out as they would
have been if a second series had been placed within, between
them and the cella; according to the classification of Vitruvius
the temple was a pseudodipteral. On account of the interval
thus afforded between the entrance of the cella and the columns
in front (a little over sixteen feet), it was thought proper
to leave the number of columns uneven, so that one stood over
against the middle of the doorway.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>

<p>The temple was of mixed construction, part stone and part
wood. The entablature must have been of stone, otherwise the
intercolumniations would not have been so narrow. The space
between the entablature and the cella, however, could only have
been bridged by means of timbers. The stone used was the
gray tufa, but the capitals were of the more durable Sarno limestone.
The surface was coated with stucco, which in part at
least was painted in bright colors. The projecting edge of the
eaves trough, also covered with stucco, was painted red, yellow,
and black, and ornamented with waterspouts in the shape of
lions' heads alternating with rosettes.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig063" id="fig063"></a>
<img src="images/fig063.jpg" width="412" height="207" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 63.&mdash;The Doric temple, restored.</p>
</div>

<p>The proportions of the columns (lower diameter 6.07 feet,
upper diameter 3.12 feet) with their flaring capitals, and the
narrow intercolumniations (<a href="#fig063">Fig. 63</a>), point to an early period;
the archaic character of the capitals will be more fully appreciated
if they are compared with those of the colonnade of the
Forum Triangulare. In respect to age this temple ranks with
the oldest of those at Selinunto; it must have been built in the
sixth century <span class="s08">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The cella, as our plan shows, was divided into two chambers.
In the inner chamber (3) a large rectangular flag is embedded
in the floor at one side so that a second (indicated on the plan
by dotted lines) must have been near it; the supports of a stone
table in front of the image of the divinity perhaps rested on
them. On the long pedestal at the right of the cella stood a
deer of terra cotta, above life size, of which some fragments
have been found.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<p>Directly in front of the temple, at the foot of the steps, we
find a monument of an altogether unusual character. The
respect with which it was regarded is evidenced by its location
in the place ordinarily occupied by the principal altar. It consists
of a small enclosure of peculiar shape, fenced in by an
outer wall and a low inner wall. To judge from its form, it
must have been a place of burial; we shall find a tomb later the
plan of which is quite similar (<a href="#plan5">Plan V</a>, right side, 2), and it is
said that human bones were found here. These walls are not
earlier than the imperial period, but they must have taken the
place of an older structure; for the altars were evidently put
over near the east corner of the temple (6 on the plan), because
the place which they would naturally have had was already occupied.
For a time&mdash;how long it would be idle to conjecture&mdash;this
was beyond doubt the most important temple of the city;
the placing of the tomb in the most sacred spot in front of it
suggests that the founder or founders of the city may have been
buried here, and afterwards revered as heroes.</p>

<p>Instead of a single altar in front of the temple there are three,
all made of blocks of tufa, two of them resting on a single foundation;
the third is built on the ground without a foundation,
and is of later date. One altar is larger than the other two, and
its surface is divided into three parts.</p>

<p>Not far from the altars are the remains of a small round
structure (7 on the plan, shown in <a href="#fig061">Fig. 61</a>) about twelve feet
in diameter. The roof, supported by eight Doric columns, was
over the mouth of a well, which had been driven down through
the old lava bed till living water was found for cleaning the temple
and for religious rites. According to the Oscan inscription
on the architrave the well house was built by N. Trebius, chief
administrative officer (<i>meddix tuticus</i>) of the city.</p>

<p>It is impossible to determine what divinities were worshipped
here. The placing of two altars together, one being divided
into three parts, and the addition of a third, seem to imply that
three divinities received worship in common, and that besides
these two other gods were honored in this sanctuary. The terra
cotta deer furnishes a clew, but is not decisive evidence; deer
were sacred to several divinities, among others to Apollo and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
Artemis. A marble torso of about half life size, found on the
declivity south of the temple, has been identified with some
degree of probability as belonging to a statue of Apollo. Perhaps
originally Apollo and Artemis were honored here, and
with them Leto; but in an Oscan inscription discovered in 1897
the temple seems to be designated as belonging to Minerva
<a href="#Page_240">(p. 240</a>), who was perhaps also worshipped with them.</p>

<p>At the time of the eruption the temple was in ruins. It may
have been in this condition only since the earthquake of 63, or
for a longer time. That the worship might not be abandoned a
poor shrine was built among the ruins, smaller than the old
cella and a little further to the right; a drum of a column, set
up on the flag in the floor of the cella, served as a pedestal for
the image of the divinity.

<h3>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE LARGE THEATRE</i></span></h3>

<p>Performances upon the stage were first given in Rome in
the year 364 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>; a pestilence was raging, and the Romans
thought to appease the gods by a new kind of celebration in
their honor. The performers were brought from Etruria, and
the exercises were limited to dancing, with an accompaniment
on the flute. There was as yet no Latin drama. The first
regular play was presented more than a century later, in 240
<span class="s08">B.C.</span>, and the playwright was not a Roman but a Greek from
Tarentum, Livius Andronicus, who translated both tragedies
and comedies from his native tongue. The next dramatist was
a Campanian, Gnaeus Naevius. The building of a theatre was
not yet thought of; a temporary wooden platform was erected
for the actors, and the spectators spread themselves out on
the green slope of a hillside facing it.</p>

<p>When the censor Cassius Longinus in 154 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> commenced
the erection of a theatre on the Palatine hill near the temple of
Cybele, at whose festivals plays were given, the ex-consul Scipio
Nasica rose in the Senate and in a speech full of feeling warned
the Romans not to countenance this foreign amusement, on the
ground that it would sap the foundations of the national character.
His words produced so deep an impression that the Senate not
only voted to pull down the part of the building already erected,
and to refuse permission for the erection of similar buildings in
the future, but even prohibited altogether the renting of seats at
theatrical representations; Romans who wished to see a play
must remain standing during a performance, or sit on the
ground. Naturally so stringent measures could not long remain
in force. Nine years later Mummius, the destroyer of Corinth,
presented dramas in connection with his triumph, and put up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
wooden seats for the spectators. The first stone theatre in
Rome was built by Pompey, the rival of Caesar, in 55 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> In
Pompeii, on the contrary, a permanent theatre had been erected
at least a hundred years earlier.</p>

<p>The Oscan culture was so completely merged in that of Rome
that our knowledge of it as an independent development is
extremely slight; and no information has come down to us
regarding the history of the native drama. From literary
sources we know only of a crude form of popular comedy in
which, as in the Italian Commedia dell' arte, there were stock
characters distinguished by their masks,&mdash;Maccus a buffoon,
Bucco a voracious, talkative lout, Pappus an old man who is
always cheated, and Dossennus a knave. The scene of these
exhibitions was always Atella, the Gotham of Campania, whence
they were called Atellan farces.</p>

<p>The Theatre at Pompeii, however, is a proof that as early as
the second century <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, in at least one Campanian city, dramatic
representations of a high order were given. Here, perhaps, as
at Athens, they were associated with the worship of Dionysus;
for the satyrs were companions of the Wine-god, and the head
of a satyr, carved in tufa, still projects from the keystone of the
arch at the outer end of one of the vaulted passages leading to
the orchestra. Greek verse, and native verse modelled after the
Greek, must have gained a hearing at Pompeii, and the works of
Oscan poets&mdash;not a line of which has come down to us&mdash;must
have stirred the hearts of the people long before Livius Andronicus,
and Naevius, who brought inspiration from his Campanian
home, produced their dramas at Rome.</p>

<p>In describing the Theatre it will be best to take up in order
the three main divisions common to Greek and Roman buildings
of this class: the <i>cavea</i>, the large outer part shaped somewhat
like half a funnel, containing seats for spectators; the orchestra,
the small semicircular portion enclosed by the cavea, with an
entrance, <i>parodos</i>, on either side; and the stage, facing the orchestra
and the cavea. The accompanying illustrations give a
plan (<a href="#fig064">Fig. 64</a>), and a view of the ruins in their present condition
(<a href="#fig065">Fig. 65</a>); the exterior as seen from the south is shown in
<a href="#fig061">Fig. 61</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>The cavea afforded seats for about five thousand persons. The
greater part of it, from the orchestra to the vaulted corridor
under the summa cavea (<a href="#fig064">Fig. 64</a>, 6), lies on the slope of the
hill; the floor of the corridor is on a level with the Forum
Triangulare.</p>

<p>The seats are arranged in three semicircular sections. The
lowest, <i>ima cavea</i> (4), next to the orchestra, contains four broad
ledges on which, as well as in the orchestra itself, the members
of the city council, the decurions,
could place their chairs, the 'seats
of double width.'</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p>The middle section, <i>media cavea</i>
(5), was much deeper, extending
from the ima cavea to the vaulted
corridor. It contained twenty rows
of marble seats arranged like steps,
of which only a small portion is
preserved. On a part of one of
these, individual places, a little less
than 16 inches wide, are marked
off by vertical lines in front, and
numbered; they probably belonged
to some corporation which found
it necessary, in order to avoid confusion,
to assign places to its members by number. In Rome
the fourteen rows nearest the bottom were reserved for the
knights. Whether a similar arrangement prevailed in the municipalities
and the colonies is not known, but if so the number
reserved here must have been smaller.</p>

<p>The upper section, <i>summa cavea</i> (6), supported by the vault
over the corridor, was too narrow to have contained more than
four rows of seats.</p>

<p>The ima cavea was entered from the orchestra. The media
cavea could be entered on the lower side from the passage
(<i>diazoma</i>, <i>praecinctio</i>) between it and the ima cavea, which at
the ends was connected by short flights of steps with the
parodoi leading outside; on the upper side six doors opened
into the media cavea from the corridor, from which flights of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
steps descended dividing the seats into five wedgelike blocks,
<i>cunei</i>, with a small oblong block in addition on either side near
the end of the stage.</p>

<p>The corridor was accessible by four doors, one from the
Forum Triangulare, another from the open space between this
and the rounded exterior of the Theatre, a third at the end of
an alley east of the temple of Isis, and a fourth opening from a
steep passage leading up from Stabian Street. The summa
cavea, which for convenience we may call the gallery, was
entered by several doors (the exact number is uncertain) from
a narrow vaulted passage along the outside. This passage,
however, did not extend the whole length of the gallery, but
stopped where the outer wall of the Theatre joined that of the
Forum Triangulare. Here a stairway led to it; there was a
second stairway at the rear of the Palaestra, and a third leading
from the alley east of the temple of Isis; the three are shown
on <a href="#plan3">Plan III</a>. At the edge of the Forum Triangulare, a narrow
stairway, built in the thick wall, led directly to the gallery
(<a href="#fig064">Fig. 64</a>).</p>

<p>The outer wall back of the gallery rose to a considerable
height above the last row of seats. On the inside near the top
were projecting blocks of basalt (seen in <a href="#fig065">Fig. 65</a>), containing
round holes in which strong wooden masts were set; from these
the great awning, <i>velum</i>, was stretched over the cavea and
orchestra to the roof of the stage, protecting the spectators
from the sun. This sort of covering for the theatre was a
Campanian invention, and here, where the cavea opened toward
the south, was especially necessary. In the Coliseum, and the
well preserved theatre at Orange, the arrangements for fastening
the masts are on the outside of the wall. The upper part
of the wall of our Theatre has been rebuilt in modern times, and
it has been doubted whether the blocks of basalt and the pieces
of cornice above with corresponding incisions are ancient; the
latter surely are not modern, and their slightly wedged shape
shows that from the beginning they must have been on the
inside of the wall.</p>

<p>Near the front of the orchestra at the right and the left were
small rectangular platforms; one is shown in <a href="#fig065">Fig. 65</a>. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
were supported by the vaults over the entrances (7, 7), and
were reached by small stairways near the ends of the stage.
They were called tribunals, and here, as in Rome, were no
doubt reserved for the seats of those to whom special honor
was paid. One was set aside for the use of the magistrate who
gave the play; in Rome the vestal virgins, in accordance with
a decree of Augustus, occupied the other, and in Pompeii their
place was very likely taken by the city priestesses.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig065" id="fig065"></a>
<img src="images/fig065.jpg" width="531" height="401" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 65.&mdash;View of the Large Theatre.</p>
</div>

<p>The shape of the orchestra is that of a semicircle enlarged
in the direction of tangents at right angles with the diameter;
a complete circle could be inscribed in the space. It was
probably never used for a chorus, but was occupied by the seats
of prominent spectators, particularly the city officials and their
friends. It was entered by means of the vaulted passages under
the tribunals.</p>

<p>The steps leading from the orchestra upon the stage (<a href="#fig065">Fig. 65</a>)
can be explained only on the supposition that even in the
Roman period, to which the steps in their present form belong,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
actors who took the part of persons arriving from distant places
came upon the stage through the orchestra. In the niches in
front of the stage, as we learn from a wall painting, sat those
charged with the maintenance of order in the Theatre, two
perhaps in the rectangular niches, or one in the semicircular
niche in the middle.</p>

<p>The stage is long and narrow, measuring 120 by 24 Oscan
feet; the floor is a little more than three feet above the level
of the orchestra. The rear wall, as in ancient theatres generally,
was built to represent the front of a palace, entered by
three doors, and adorned with columns and niches for statues.
In each of the short sections of wall at the ends of the stage is
a broad doorway, extending across almost the entire space.
The long narrow room behind the stage, used as a dressing
room (<i>postscaenium</i>), was entered by a door at the rear, which
was reached by an inclined approach. No trace of the roof
of the stage remains, but from the better preserved theatres at
Orange, in the south of France, and at Aspendus, in Asia
Minor, we infer that it sloped back toward the rear wall. The
floor was of wood.</p>

<p>The room underneath the stage was divided into several
parts. Between the front wall and that just back of it
(seen in <a href="#fig065">Fig. 65</a>) was the place for the curtain, which, as in
Roman theatres, was let down at the beginning of the play,
and raised at the end. The space between the parallel walls
must have been covered, leaving only a narrow slit for the curtain;
otherwise it would not have been easy to go upon the
stage from the steps in the orchestra.</p>

<p>Underneath the place for the curtain is a low passage, in
the vaulted roof of which are two rows of holes, a little more
than a foot square, cut in blocks of basalt, and evidently
designed to hold upright timbers. This passage has in recent
years been entirely cleared. In the floor, directly under the
openings in the vaulted roof and corresponding with them, were
square holes. In those nearer the front of the stage were
remains of timbers and of square pieces of iron fitted to the
ends of these, a larger and a smaller piece for each hole. It
seems likely that, as Mazois suggested, hollow upright beams
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
were set in the holes, and in them smaller hollow beams were
placed, in which were still smaller poles or iron rods; by the
sliding of these up and down, the long horizontal pole on which
the curtain was hung could be raised or lowered. The use of
the inner row of holes has not been satisfactorily explained.</p>

<p>The room under the right of the stage is so low, about three
feet, that it could not have been available for any purpose, but
that at the left is higher, and was used for theatrical machinery,
the scanty remains of which arouse our curiosity without satisfying
it. In the floor are set two oblong blocks of limestone,
about four feet in length. Each has in its upper surface a round
hole, between two and three inches deep, with an iron socket,
in which there are still remains of an iron cap once fitted
to the lower end of a vertical wooden shaft that turned in
it; the upper end of the shaft&mdash;assuming that the blocks are
in their original position&mdash;must have revolved in a socket fixed
in one of the joists of the stage floor. There is besides on the
upper surface of each block a rectangular depression, and on
either side a shallow incision; the purpose is altogether obscure.
A third stone, similar to these two, is set in the north wall of
the same room, and opposite it was fitted another; here, then, a
horizontal shaft turned; there was a similar pair of stones at the
left end of the place for the curtain. These arrangements
suggest the crane-like machine by which floating figures were
brought upon the stage, as Medea in the play of Euripides
riding in a chariot drawn by dragons, and the familiar <i>deus ex
machina</i>; such machinery, according to Pollux (Onomast. IV.
128), was placed on the left side of the stage.</p>

<p>When plays were presented, the front of the palace at the
back of the stage was concealed by painted scenery. As several
pieces might be produced one after the other, it was
necessary to arrange for the shifting of scenes. This was accomplished
by drawing one set of decorations off to the sides,
thus bringing the next set into view (<i>scaena ductilis</i>); the ends
were changed by turning the <i>periactoi</i>, huge three-sided prisms,
each side of which was suited to a different scene (<i>scaena versilis</i>).
In spite of the clumsiness of the arrangements, as
contrasted with those of the best modern theatres, the mounting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
of plays was artistic and impressive, and compares favorably
with that of Shakespeare's time.</p>

<p>The only allusions to matters connected with theatrical representations
at Pompeii are in inscriptions relating to actors, as
Sorex <a href="#Page_176">(p. 176</a>). A number of graffiti scratched on walls in
various parts of the city mention an Actius Anicetus, whose
name is given in full in an inscription found at Puteoli,
C. Ummidius Actius Anicetus. He seems to have been a very
popular actor of pantomime, at the head of a troupe. One of
the inscriptions reads: <i>Acti, a[mor] populi, cito redi</i>,&mdash;'Actius,
darling of the people, come back quickly!'</p>

<p>The theatre in antiquity was by no means reserved for scenic
representations alone. It was a convenient place for bringing the
people together, and was used for public gatherings of the
most varied character. In the theatre at Tarentum the memorable
assembly met which heaped insults upon the Roman
ambassadors and precipitated war with Rome. At Pergamos
King Mithridates was to be crowned in the theatre by a descending
Victory, but by some mishap the wreath fell to the
floor, an omen of evil. When the Ephesians, stirred up by
Demetrius the silversmith, wished to take measures against
Paul and his companions, "They rushed with one accord into
the theatre." On such occasions we may suppose that the
front of the palace at the rear of the stage served as a background
without other decoration. This use of the theatre for
general purposes was a Greek rather than a Roman custom,
but the theatre itself in Italy was an importation from Greece;
and we may suppose that the theatre at Pompeii was on more
than one occasion the scene of notable demonstrations.</p>

<p>Our Theatre, as is evident from the character of the construction,
in its original form belonged to the Tufa Period, but
was rebuilt in Roman times. Some particulars in regard to the
rebuilding are given in an inscription: <i>M. M. Holconii Rufus
et Celer cryptam, tribunalia, theatrum</i>,&mdash;'Marcus Holconius
Rufus and Marcus Holconius Celer (built) the crypt, the tribunals,
and the part designed for spectators,' that is, the vaulted
corridor under the gallery, the platforms over the entrances to
the orchestra, and the cavea.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<p>The two Holconii lived in the time of Augustus. The elder,
Rufus, was duumvir for the fourth term in 3-2 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> The work
on the Theatre was probably done about that time; for soon
afterwards, before his fifth duumvirate, a statue in his honor
was erected in the Theatre, as we learn from an inscription.
Later, in 13-14 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>, the younger Holconius also, when he had
been chosen quinquennial duumvir, was honored with a statue.
The masonry of the corridor and of the exterior arches supporting
it, as well as of the tribunals, well agrees with that in
vogue in the Augustan Age; we find brick-shaped blocks of
tufa and reticulate work. The marble seats in the cavea may
be assigned to the same period; in the original structure the
benches must have been of tufa. About the same time the
present wall at the back of the stage was built, in the place of
an older and much simpler façade, but not by the Holconii; if
this also had been rebuilt by them, it would have been mentioned
in the inscription.</p>

<p>Possibly the tribunals were an addition due to the Holconii.
The corridor under the gallery, however, must have
been built in the place of an earlier corridor, for the piers on
the outside rest on foundations similar in character to the
oldest parts of the building. As these piers served no other
purpose than to sustain the passage opening into the section
of seats above the corridor, this must have formed a part of the
original plan.</p>

<p>The statues of both the Holconii probably stood in niches
in the wall at the back of the stage. Holconius Rufus was
further honored with a monument of some sort in the cavea.
The lowest seat of the media cavea had at the middle, directly
opposite the stage, a double width for a distance of about five
feet, gained by removing a portion of the next seat above.
Here was an inscription in bronze letters: <i>M. Holconio M. f.
Rufo, II. v. i. d. quinquiens, iter[um] quinq[uennali], trib[uno]
mil[itum] a p[opulo], flamini Aug[usti], patr[ono] colo[niae],
d[ecurionum] d[ecreto]</i>,&mdash;'[Dedicated] in accordance with a
decree of the city council to Marcus Holconius Rufus the son
of Marcus, five times duumvir with judiciary authority, twice
quinquennial duumvir, military tribune by the choice of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
people, priest of Augustus, and patron of the colony.' The
object placed here was of bronze, and was made secure by
fastenings set in twelve holes; what it was is altogether uncertain.
The ancients had the custom of conferring lasting
honor upon a deserving man after death by placing in the
theatre a seat inscribed with his name. We should be glad to
believe that a 'seat of double width,' <i>bisellium</i>, the use of
which was allowed to members of the city council, was placed
here, but the arrangement of the twelve holes is difficult to
reconcile with this explanation.</p>

<p>The architect employed by the Holconii, a freedman, was
not honored with a statue, but his name was transmitted to
posterity in an inscription placed in the outer wall near the
east entrance to the orchestra: <i>M. Artorius M. l[ibertus]
Primus, architectus</i>,&mdash;'Marcus Artorius Primus, freedman of
Marcus, architect.'</p>

<p>The plan of the Theatre could not have been taken from a
Roman model; it conforms, as we should have expected, to the
Greek type. In the Roman theatre the orchestra was in the
form of a semicircle, of which the diameter was represented
by the stage. In Greek theatres, on the contrary, the stage
according to Vitruvius was laid out on one side of a square inscribed
in the circle of the orchestra; the orchestra, as shown
by existing remains, in most cases was either a complete circle
or was so extended by tangents at the sides that a circle could
be inscribed in it. The latter is the case in our Theatre, of
which the orchestra has essentially the same form as that of
the theatre of Dionysus at Athens.</p>

<p>The stage falls under the limit of height,&mdash;five feet,&mdash;allowed
by Vitruvius for the stage of the Roman theatre, not
to mention the height of ten to twelve feet specified for that
of the Greek type. The reason assigned for the moderate elevation
of the Roman stage is that the orchestra was occupied
by the seats of senators, whose view would be obstructed
if more than a moderate elevation should be given to the front
of the stage. The orchestra of our Theatre was apparently
from the beginning intended for the use of spectators, not
for a chorus.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span></p>

<p>The conclusions reached by Dr. William Doerpfeld in regard
to the stage of the Greek theatre, if borne out by the facts, would
necessitate a complete abandonment of previous views on the
subject. His theory, in brief, is, that not only the chorus but
also the actors went through their parts not on the stage but in
the orchestra, which had the form of a circle, and that what we
are accustomed to consider the front wall of the stage was
rather the rear wall of the platform in the orchestra on which
the actors and chorus stood, this wall being laid out on a tangent
of the circle and having a height of twelve feet, as we
may understand from Vitruvius and from the remains of the
theatre at Epidaurus.</p>

<p>The main reasons advanced in support of this theory are that
the platform currently regarded as the stage, which according
to Vitruvius and the existing remains was hardly more than ten
feet wide, must have been too narrow to allow free movement
on the part of the actors, and that the height above the orchestra
was too great to admit of the close relation between the actors
and the chorus, of which there is abundant evidence in the
extant dramas. According to Dr. Doerpfeld, the stage came
into existence in Italy first, and in the Roman period, when there
was no longer any chorus; a platform five feet high was built
for the actors, extending to the middle of the orchestra, so that
this now took the form of a semicircle and could be used for the
seats of spectators.</p>

<p>To undertake the examination of Dr. Doerpfeld's theory in
detail would not be pertinent here; yet we cannot bring our
description of the Theatre at Pompeii to a close without inquiring
whether this structure, which is perhaps a century older
than the oldest Roman theatre, shows any trace of the arrangement
which the theory assumes. Unfortunately, the evidence is
not conclusive for either a negative or an affirmative answer.
Just as this second edition goes to press a joint investigation of
the whole matter has been undertaken by the author and Dr.
Doerpfeld, whose work is being facilitated by excavations. It
is yet too early to anticipate the conclusions to which the evidence
thus gained will lead; we may hazard a tentative statement
in regard to only one or two points.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<p>It now appears probable that the present stage was not constructed
at the same time with the other parts of the Theatre,
but that it is a later addition. There is no trace of an earlier
stage, and there is nothing to indicate that this was built against
the part of the structure designed for the spectators. We might
assume that this earlier stage was placed at a slight distance from
the other parts of the building, and that the entrances of the
orchestra, the parodoi, lay between, were it not for the fact that
the outer doorways of the present parodoi&mdash;notably that on the
west side with the head of a satyr on the keystone&mdash;unquestionably
belong to the original structure; and we should not be
warranted in assuming two entrances to the orchestra on each
side. At the same time it is evident that the construction of
the tribunalia must have involved a rebuilding of this part of the
Theatre, and it is possible that originally passages led from the
outer doors of the present parodoi, not to the orchestra, but to
the ranges of seats. In that case, assuming that the stage was
slightly removed from the rest of the structure, we may freely
grant that the acting may have gone on in front of it rather
than upon it, and that this may have been a Greek theatre
according to Dr. Doerpfeld's view. But we are here dealing only
with possibilities; it is to be hoped that further investigation
will bring to light data for a final solution of the problem.</p>

<p>In the open space between the Theatre, the Forum Triangulare,
and the Palaestra there is a deep reservoir for water (D),
square on the outside and round within. It was evidently used
for the sprinklings, <i>sparsiones</i>, with saffron-colored water, by
which on summer days the heat of the Theatre was mollified.
That such sprinklings were in vogue in Pompeii is known from
announcements of gladiatorial combats, painted on walls, in
which they are advertised together with an awning as part of
the attraction,&mdash;<i>sparsiones, vela erunt</i>.

<h3>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE SMALL THEATRE</i></span></h3>

<p>The names of the builders of the Small Theatre are known
from an inscription which is found in duplicate in different parts
of the building: <i>C. Quinctius C. f. Valg[us], M. Porcius M. f.
duovir[i] dec[urionum] decr[eto] theatrum tectum fac[iundum]
locar[unt] eidemq[ue] prob[arunt]</i>,&mdash;'Gaius Quinctius Valgus
the son of Gaius and Marcus Porcius the son of Marcus, duumvirs,
in accordance with a decree of the city council let the contract
for building the covered theatre, and approved the work.'
Later the same officials, when, after the customary interval, they
had been elected quinquennial duumvirs, built the Amphitheatre
'at their own expense' <a href="#Page_212">(p. 212</a>).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;"><a name="fig066" id="fig066"></a>

<li>2. Stage.</li>
<li>3, 3. Tribunals.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>When two magistrates set up an inscription in duplicate, ordinarily
the name of one appears first in one copy, while that of
the second is put first in the other. In all
four inscriptions, however, two at the Small
Theatre and two at the Amphitheatre, Valgus
has the first place. The reason in the case of
the Amphitheatre is not far to seek: Valgus
was the man of means, who furnished the
money for the building, but allowed his colleague
and friend to share in the honor. We
may also believe that, while the Small Theatre
was erected 'in accordance with a decree
of the city council,' and hence presumably at
public expense, a part of the funds was contributed by Valgus, who
on this account received honor above his less opulent colleague.</p>

<p>The son-in-law of this Valgus, Publius Servilius Rullus, has
been undeservedly immortalized by a speech of Cicero in opposition
to a bill brought forward by him in regard to the division
of the public lands. From the same oration we learn that Valgus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
a man without scruples, had taken advantage of the reign
of terror instituted by Sulla to acquire vast wealth, particularly
in the way of landed property. Among his estates was one in
the country of the Hirpini, near the city of Aeclanum (south of
Beneventum), which made him its patron and for which, as
shown by an inscription, he repaired the walls destroyed in the
Civil War. He was undoubtedly one of the leading men in the
colony founded by Sulla at Pompeii, and very likely sought by
large public benefactions to cast his former life into oblivion.
The Small Theatre must have been built in the early years of
the Roman colony, not long after 80 <span class="s08">B.C.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig067" id="fig067"></a>
<img src="images/fig067.jpg" width="537" height="423" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 67.&mdash;View of the Small Theatre.</p>
</div>

<p>A covered auditorium in the immediate vicinity of a large
unroofed theatre was not uncommon. About the time of the
destruction of Pompeii the poet Statius, praising the magnificence
of his native city Naples, speaks of 'twin theatres in a single
structure, one open and one roofed,'&mdash;<i>geminam molem nudi
tectique theatri</i>. Our only clew to the special use of such a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
building, however, is derived from the one erected at Athens by
Herodes Atticus, in the reign of Hadrian. This was called an
Odeum, that is, according to the derivation of the word, a room
for singing; musical entertainments were held there, especially,
we may assume, those musical contests which had so important
a place in ancient festivals. The purpose of the roof was doubtless
to add to the acoustic effect.</p>

<p>The plan of the Large Theatre has been discussed at so great
length that a few words will suffice in relation to that of the
smaller structure (<a href="#fig066">Fig. 66</a>). That it might be possible to cover
the enclosed space with a roof, the upper rows of seats were
reduced in length, and the whole building&mdash;cavea, orchestra,
and stage&mdash;was brought into an oblong shape; only the orchestra
and the lower rows of seats in the cavea form a complete
semicircle. The pyramidal roof was supported by a wall on all
four sides; in the upper part of the wall, between the roof and
the highest row of seats, there were probably windows.</p>

<p>The seating capacity of the building was about fifteen hundred.
The lowest section of the cavea, as in the Large Theatre, consisted
of four low, broad ledges on which
the chairs of the decurions could be placed.
Above these is a parapet, behind which
is a passage accessible at either end by
semicircular steps. The broad range of
seats above was divided into five wedge-shaped
blocks by flights of steps; only two
of these, however, extended as far as the passage running along
the upper side, which could be reached from the alley at the rear
of the building by means of stairways connecting with outside
doors.</p>

</div>

<p>The seats were of masonry capped with slabs of tufa about
seven inches thick. They had depressions in the side and in
the top, as may be seen in the accompanying section (<a href="#fig068">Fig. 68</a>).
They were thus made somewhat more comfortable, the person
in front being less subject to disturbance from the feet of one
sitting on the next seat behind; a saving of room was also
effected&mdash;an important consideration in the construction of
a small auditorium.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span></p>

<p>The tribunals (3, 3) differed from those in the Large Theatre
in that they were shut off entirely from the seats of the cavea
by a sharply inclined wall, and were entered only from the stage,
by means of narrow stairways; in this way the exclusive
character of the seats was made still more
prominent. Besides the platform itself, measuring
only about 11 by 9 feet, three seats above
each tribunal were set off with it by the same division
wall and were available for the occupants.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 69.&mdash;An Atlas.</p>
</div>

<p>The sloping wall between the tribunal and the
cavea on each side ends with a kneeling Atlas
(<a href="#fig069">Fig. 69</a>); large vases probably stood on the two
brackets supported by these figures. The end
of the parapet on either side is embellished with a lion's foot of
tufa (<a href="#fig070">Fig. 70</a>). These rather coarse sculptures illustrate the
character of the art that was brought to Pompeii
by the Roman colony. The workmanship is by no
means fine, yet the muscles of the figures are well
rendered, and the effect is pleasing.</p>

<p>The pavement of the orchestra (seen in <a href="#fig067">Fig. 67</a>)
consists of small flags of colored marble. An inscription
in bronze letters informs us that it was
laid by the duumvir Marcus Oculatius Verus <i>pro
ludis</i>, that is instead of the games which he would
otherwise have been expected to provide.</p>

<p>At the ends of the stage, as in the case of the Large Theatre,
there were two broad entrances. The wall at the rear, which
was veneered with marble, had the customary three doors, and
in addition two small doors, one near each end. The long
dressing room behind the stage had likewise two broad entrances
at the ends, besides four at the rear. Apparently the two narrow
doors near the ends of the wall at the rear of the stage, and
the two doors corresponding with them at the back of the dressing
room, were for the use of those who had seats on the tribunals;
they could thus enter and leave their places even when the
large side doors of both stage and dressing room had been shut&mdash;as
undoubtedly happened immediately after the procession
(<i>pompa</i>) had passed across the stage.

</div>

<p>This maxim of
ancient architects
was applied
at Pompeii in a
generous way;
in connection
with the theatres
there was an extensive
system
of colonnades.
To understand
their use it will
be necessary first
to view them as
they were in the
earlier time, and
then to take account
of later
changes.</p>

<p>In the Oscan Period, and afterwards to the end of the Republic,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
when a performance in the Large Theatre was interrupted
by a shower, the spectators in the upper seats could
take refuge under the colonnade of the Forum Triangulare;
those below found shelter under the rectangular colonnade
at the rear, which was obviously built for the purpose, and
may be called, by way of distinction, the Theatre Colonnade
(<a href="#fig071">Fig. 71</a>). It contained seventy-four Doric columns, and enclosed
a large open area. The main entrance (2) was near the
northeast corner. The entrance hall on the side of the colonnade
was supported by three Ionic columns. It was connected
at the north end with a short colonnade on the east side of the
area back of the stage of the Theatre; this led to the large
door at the east end of the stage and the corresponding
parodos of the orchestra; the wall at 4 on our plan is a later
addition. The Theatre Colonnade must have been used also
as a promenade on days when there was no performance; it
was connected by a broad passage (1) with Stabian Street.</p>

<p>This colonnade seems too far away to have served as a place
for making preparations for the stage; another was erected for
that purpose. At the northwest corner a broad stairway leads
down from the Forum Triangulare (5; cf. <a href="#fig065">Fig. 65</a>); from the foot
a small and inconvenient flight of steps leads into the area
at the rear of the stage. In a line with the stairway is a series
of small rooms opening toward the south. These do not belong
to the original structure. In their place there was once a colonnade,
which faced the north and connected the large stairway
with the short colonnade, the remains of which are still to be
seen on the east side of the area; the back of it was at the
same time the back of the north division of the Theatre Colonnade.
There was thus a covered passage extending from the
foot of the stairway along two sides of the area to the east
entrance of the stage and of the orchestra, which would answer
very well to the second part of Vitruvius's dictum; but it had
also another important use.</p>

<p>The portico of the Forum Triangulare, as we have seen, was
at the same time the monumental entrance of the Theatre, and
the large doorway at the left was used only for the ceremonious
admission of the city officials, who with their retinue formed a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
procession in the Forum and wended their way hither in festal
attire in order to open the performance&mdash;a formality that may
be compared with the parade with which the Roman games
were opened at Rome.</p>

<p>The route of such a procession, after entering the Forum
Triangulare, is now clear. It passed along under the colonnade
adjoining the Theatre, beyond the entrances to the upper
portion of the cavea; turned and descended the broad stairway
(5), proceeded under the colonnade along the south and
east sides of the area behind the stage, and finally came upon the
stage through the wide doorway at the east end. It was indeed
possible to pass beyond the stage entrance and proceed through
the parodos directly to the seats of the orchestra and the lowest
section of the cavea; but it is more in accordance with the fondness
of the ancients for display to suppose that the procession
moved across the stage, receiving as it passed the plaudits of
the great audience, and emerged from the entrance opposite
that by which it came in, disbanding in the court, whence the
members could go to their respective seats. We need not here
raise the question whether the procession passed upon the stage
behind the triangular side screens (<i>periactoi</i>), or whether these
were set in place only after it had already passed.</p>

<p>When the colonnade on the south side of the court had been
replaced by rooms, and the Theatre Colonnade itself had been
transformed into barracks, this route of the processions was
blocked. They could still pass down the street in front of the
temple of Isis, turn into Stabian Street, and reach the stage
through the passage at the rear of the Small Theatre; but it
does not seem probable that they followed this course, for the
reason that there are three large stepping stones in the street
before one comes to the entrance of the passage; these would
have proved a serious obstruction, and would undoubtedly have
been removed had the processions gone this way.</p>

<p>We may rather believe that before the usual route was closed
the processions themselves had been given up. They were still
in vogue, however, when the Small Theatre was built; otherwise
the purpose of the wide entrances at the ends of the stage
and of the room back of it is not clear. Moreover the sidewalk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
in front of the Small Theatre, on Stabian Street, is of an altogether
unusual width, and was apparently covered by a portico.
We infer that the procession to this theatre entered at the west
end of the stage, and passed out at the east end; since it could
not disperse on the street, it would turn where the sidewalk was
broadest, go back through the room at the rear of the stage
into the court, and there disband.</p>

<p>The discontinuance of the processions must then be assigned
to the period between the building of the Small Theatre and
the changing over of the Theatre Colonnade into barracks, which,
to judge from the masonry and the remains of the decoration,
did not take place before the time of Nero. The processions
were abandoned either in the troubled period of the Civil Wars,
or in the early years of the Empire; if in the latter period, their
discontinuance may have been due to legislation connected with
the reorganization of the Empire under Augustus, or to the
overshadowing of them by more imposing ceremonies introduced
in connection with the religious festivals.</p>

<p>Our information in regard to the later use of the Theatre
Colonnade is indeed meagre; not a single inscription bearing
upon it has been found. Yet when we take into account the
changes that were made in it, and the objects found there, the
supposition that it was turned into barracks for gladiators in
the time of the Early Empire, and so used till the destruction of
the city, is seen to harmonize with almost all the facts.</p>

<p>First, rooms were built on all sides behind the colonnade; on
the north side they took the place of the south arm of the colonnade
in the area back of the stage. They were in two series,
one above the other; the upper rooms were entered from a low
wooden gallery accessible by three stairways. They could not
have been intended for shops; they were too small, measuring
on the average hardly more than twelve feet square, and the
doors were too narrow. There were no doors opening from one
room into the other. Both lower and upper rooms, we may
conclude, were used for men's quarters.</p>

<div class="figcenter p6"><a name="plate04" id="plate04"></a>
<img src="images/plate04.jpg" width="600" height="415" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PLATE IV.&mdash;THE BARRACKS OF THE GLADIATORS, LOOKING SOUTH</p>
</div>

<p>In the middle of the south side a large room was left, with
the front open toward the area, an exedra (6). On the east
side was a still larger room the front of which is divided off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
by pillars; other rooms open from it, and among them is one
(10) with several hearths, evidently intended for a mess kitchen,
if the hearths are ancient; they may be modern. Over these
rooms was a second story, reached by a broad stairway (9).</p>

<p>The immediate connection of the colonnade with the area
behind the stage was now cut off by a wall (4); there was left
only a small door in the corner, which could be readily fastened.
The entrance from the passage leading to Stabian Street (2)
was provided with doors and placed under the control of a
guard, for whom a special room was built at one side (3).
There was a third entrance, narrow and easily closed, at the
northwest corner, where a flight of steps connected the foot of
the broad stairway (5) with the landing of the stairs leading to
the wooden gallery.</p>

<p>Thus a complete transformation was effected. The promenade
for theatre-goers had become barracks, with a great number
of cell-like rooms, a mess kitchen, and narrow, guarded entrances.
Soldiers, however, could not have been kept here; in the period
to which the rebuilding belongs, garrisons were not stationed in
the cities of Italy except the Capital. On the other hand, gladiatorial
combats in Pompeii were so frequent, and on so large a
scale, that a special building for the housing and guarding of
gladiators would seem to have been a necessity; such a building
would naturally have been erected by the city and placed at the
disposal of those who gave the games. As early as the time of
Augustus, Aulus Clodius Flaccus brought forward forty pairs
of gladiators in a single day, and on various occasions afterwards
as many as thirty pairs were engaged. How well the colonnade
was now suited for gladiators' quarters may be seen from a
glance at the plan. The area would serve as a practice court,
the exedra on the south side (6), protected from the sun, as the
station for the trainers and lounging room for men awaiting their
turn; the mess room would be the large apartment adjoining the
kitchen (11), while the quarters of the chief trainer, <i>lanista</i>, and
his assistants, would be in the second story, reached by the broad
stairway (9).</p>

<p>The small rooms were poorly decorated, in the fourth style.
There were better paintings only in the exedra. On the rear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
wall of this room was the oft repeated group of Mars and Venus;
on the side walls, gladiatorial weapons were represented, piled
up in heaps, after the manner of trophies, about eight feet high.
The reference to the purpose of the building, as in the case of
the paintings in the Macellum, is obvious. The columns about
the area were originally white; after the rebuilding the unfluted
lower part was painted red, the upper part yellow. Four columns,
however, two at the middle of the east side, and the two
opposite them on the west side, were painted blue, probably to
serve as bounds in marking off the area for athletic exercises.</p>

<p>The objects found in the barracks are recorded in the journal
of the excavations. They indicate that at the time of the eruption
the rooms were occupied. Everything
of value was removed from those on the north
side by the survivors, but the south half was
apparently left undisturbed, and has yielded
a rich harvest.</p>

<div class="figleft"><a name="fig072" id="fig072"></a>
<img src="images/fig072.jpg" width="162" height="415" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 72.&mdash;A gladiator's
greave.</p>
</div>

<p>In ten rooms the excavators found a great
quantity of weapons of the kinds used by
gladiators, including fifteen helmets, a shield,
greaves (<a href="#fig072">Fig. 72</a>), several broad belts
trimmed with metal, and a couple of armlets;
there were more than a hundred scales of horn
belonging to a coat of mail, and a half dozen
shoulder protectors, <i>galeri</i>, which the net
fighter, <i>retiarius</i>, who carried no shield and
was armed only with a net and a trident, wore
on his left shoulder. The weapons were
mostly for defence, but remains of a few
offensive weapons were found, as the head
of a lance, a sword, and a couple of daggers.
In the same room with the daggers and the
sword (perhaps 7) were the remains of two
wooden chests containing cloth with gold thread; this may have
been used in gladiators' costumes.</p>

<p>The helmets are characteristic (<a href="#fig073">Fig. 73</a>). They are furnished
with a visor, and part of them have a broad rim, richly ornamented
with reliefs; their shape corresponds exactly with that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
of the helmets seen in paintings and reliefs representing gladiatorial
combats. The shield, which is round and only about
sixteen inches in diameter, would have been quite useless in
military service. In a room under the stairs the skeleton of a
horse was found, with remains of trappings richly mounted with
bronze; one class of gladiators, the equites, fought on horseback.</p>

<div class="figright"><a name="fig073" id="fig073"></a>
<img src="images/fig073.jpg" width="202" height="214" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 73.&mdash;A gladiator's helmet.</p>
</div>

<p>One of the small rooms on the west side (8) was used as
a guard room. Here were the stocks, the remains of which are
shown in <a href="#fig074">Fig. 74</a>; they were fastened
to a board. At one end of the under
piece was a lock, by which the bar
passed through the rings could be
made secure. The men confined had
the choice of lying down or sitting in
an uncomfortable position. The four
persons whose skeletons were found
in this room, however, were not in
the stocks at the time of the eruption.
That such means of discipline
should be employed in controlling
gladiators is entirely consistent with ancient methods.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 74.&mdash;Remains of stocks found in the guard room of the barracks.</p>
</div>

<p>Besides these finds, there were others not so easily explained.
In the two rooms in which the spearhead and the other offensive
weapons were found, there were eighteen skeletons, among
them that of a woman richly adorned with gold jewelry; she
had a necklace with emeralds, earrings, and two armbands, besides
rings and other ornaments, and in a casket a cameo, the
elaborate setting of which is in part preserved. In a room near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
the southwest corner the bones of a new-born infant were found
in an earthen jar. A number of weights also were discovered,
and vessels of terra cotta and glass; in three rooms there were
more than six dozen small saucers. Were the barracks wholly
given up to gladiators at the time of the eruption, or were some
other persons allowed to have quarters here, perhaps some of
those whose houses had been destroyed by the earthquake of 63
and had not been rebuilt? A certain conclusion cannot be
reached.

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE PALAESTRA</i></span></h3>

<p>The oblong court north of the Large Theatre, between the
entrance of the Forum Triangulare and the temple of Isis, is
the Palaestra. Originally, the enclosed area was entirely surrounded
by a colonnade, with ten columns on
the sides and five at each end; but at a comparatively
late period, probably after the earthquake
of 63, the columns at the east end were
removed and the space thus gained was added
to the temple of Isis.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;"><a name="fig075" id="fig075"></a>
<img src="images/fig075.jpg" width="136" height="95" alt="" />

<ul class="cap-list">
<li>1. Colonnade.</li>
<li>2. Pedestal.</li>
<li>3. Dressing rooms.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>A number of the columns on the other three
sides are still standing. They are Doric but of
slender proportions, the height, 10½ feet, being
equal to eight diameters, while the intercolumniations measure
about nine feet. It is doubtful whether the columns carried
a complete entablature; more likely the roof rested directly on a
wooden architrave.</p>

<p>The building clearly dates from the pre-Roman period. The
columns are of tufa coated with stucco, the dimensions of the
colonnade (90 by 36 Oscan feet) reduce to the early standard of
measurement; and an Oscan inscription was found here which
says that the building was erected by the Quaestor Vibius
Vinicius, with money which Vibius Adiranus had left by will to
the Pompeian youth. The translation of the word <i>vereiiai</i>, 'to
the youth,' otherwise doubtful, is confirmed by various facts
which indicate that the building was intended as a small
palaestra or open-air gymnasium for boys.</p>

<p>While the Palaestra had its original length, the entrance,
which is now nearer the east end, was at the middle of the
north side. Opposite it, near the colonnade on the south side,
is a pedestal of tufa, before which stands a small table of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
same stone (<a href="#fig076">Fig. 76</a>). The pedestal is reached by narrow
steps. Here stood a statue of the patron divinity of the Palaestra.
When an athletic contest was held, the wreath intended
for the victor was laid on the stone table before the god; after
the award had been made, the successful contestant took up the
wreath and dedicated it to the divinity by mounting the steps
and placing it on the head of the statue. It is evident from the
height of the steps that the contestants were boys, not men.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig076" id="fig076"></a>
<img src="images/fig076.jpg" width="539" height="434" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 76.&mdash;View of the Palaestra, with the pedestal, table, and steps.</p>
</div>

<p>On the pedestal was undoubtedly a statue of Hermes, but not
of the type which we have already met with in the court of the
temple of Apollo (<a href="#Page_88">p. 88</a>), and shall find later in the palaestra of
the Stabian Baths <a href="#Page_200">(p. 200</a>); a base of this sort can hardly have
been intended for a herm. No trace of the missing statue has
been discovered.</p>

<p>Another statue stood at the foot of one of the columns on the
south side. It is a copy of the doryphorus of Polyclitus, and is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
now in the Naples Museum (<a href="#fig077">Fig. 77</a>). Though it has been restored,
there seems no good reason to believe that the restoration
is incorrect, and that the figure is really a Hermes, having originally
carried on the left shoulder a herald's staff with entwined
snakes, <i>caduceus</i>, instead of a spear.
For the adornment of a place devoted
to athletic exercises nothing could
have been more appropriate than a
copy of the doryphorus as an ideal
of youthful strength, of harmonious
physical development; and the Elder
Pliny bears witness (N. H. XXXIV. v.
18), that it was customary to set up
such statues in a palaestra. This
figure had no pedestal; it stood on
the ground, a man among men.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 210px;"><a name="fig077" id="fig077"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 77.&mdash;Doryphorus. Statue

</div>

<p>At the west end of the court were
dressing rooms where the boys, before
exercising, could anoint themselves
and afterwards could remove
the oil and dirt with the strigil; such
a dressing room in connection with
a bath was called a destrictarium.
Water was brought into the court by
a lead pipe, which passed through
one of the columns at the right of
the entrance and threw a jet either
into a basin standing below or into the gutter in front of the
colonnade.</p>

<p>It would be of interest to know what athletic exercises were
practised in the Palaestra; but apart from the pedestal with its
steps and table no characteristic remains were found here. The
exercises in the Roman period undoubtedly differed somewhat
from those practised at the time when the building was erected,
when the Greek system was everywhere in vogue.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE TEMPLE OF ISIS</i></span></h3>

<p>The loftiest and purest religious conceptions of the ancient
Egyptians were embodied in the myth of Isis and Osiris, which
in the third millennium <span class="s08">B.C.</span> had already become the basis of
a firmly established cult. These conceptions approached the
monotheistic idea of an omnipresent god, and with them was
associated a belief in a blessed immortality. Isis was the goddess
of heaven, and Osiris was the Sun-god, her brother and
husband, who is slain at evening by his brother Set,&mdash;the Greek
Typhon,&mdash;ruler of darkness. Their child Horus, also called
Harpocrates, born after the father's death, is the fresh sun of
the new day, the successor and avenger of his father, the conqueror
of Set; he becomes a new Osiris, while the father, ever
blessed, rules in the realm of the dead, the kingdom of the
West. Man, the followers of Isis taught, is an incarnation of
deity, whose destiny is also his. He is himself an Osiris, and
will enter upon a better state of existence beyond the grave if
a favorable judgment is passed upon him in the trial given to
the dead.</p>

<p>The worship of Isis, associated with Mysteries from an early
period, was reorganized by the first Ptolemy with the help of
Manetho, an Egyptian priest, and Timotheus, a Greek skilled
in the Eleusinian Mysteries. The purpose of the king was to
unite his Egyptian and Greek subjects in one faith, and the
effort was more successful than might have been anticipated.
In its new Alexandrian form the worship of Isis and Osiris, or
Serapis, as the latter divinity was now called, spread, not only
over all Egypt, but also over the other countries in the East
into which Greek culture had penetrated, and soon made its
way to Italy and the West.</p>

<p>Various causes contributed to the rapid extension of the cult.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
It had the charm of something foreign and full of mystery.
Its doctrine, supported by the prestige of immemorial antiquity,
successfully opposed the mutually destructive opinions of the
philosophers, while at the same time its conception of deity was
by no means inconsistent with philosophic thought; and it
brought to the initiated that expectation of a future life to
which the Eleusinian Mysteries owed their attractive power.
The ascetic side of the worship, too, with its fastings and abstinence
from the pleasures of sense, that the soul might lose
itself in the mystical contemplation of deity, had a fascination
for natures that were religiously susceptible; and the celebration
of the Mysteries, the representation of the myth of Isis in
pantomime with a musical accompaniment, appealed powerfully
to the imagination. The cult also possessed elements that
brought it nearer to the needs of the multitude. The activities
of the Egyptian divinities were not confined to the other
world; their help might be sought in the concerns of this life.
Thus the chief priest could say to Apuleius that Isis summoned
her elect to consecrate themselves to her service only
when the term of life allotted to them had really expired, and
that she lengthened their tale of years, so that all of life
remaining was a direct gift from the hands of the goddess.
The priests of Isis were looked upon as experts in astrology,
the interpretation of dreams, and the conjuring of spirits.</p>

<p>A college of the Servants of Isis, Pastophori, was founded in
Rome in the time of Sulla, about 80 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> In vain the authorities
tried to drive out the worship of the Egyptian gods. Three
times their temple, in the midst of the city, was destroyed by
order of the consuls, in 58, 50, and 48 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> But after Caesar's
death, in 44 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, the triumvirs built a temple in honor of Isis
and Osiris; and a few decades later, perhaps in the reign of
Caligula, their festival was recognized in the public Calendar.
In Campania the Alexandrian cult gained a foothold earlier
than in Rome. An inscription of the year 105 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, found at
Puteoli, proves that a temple of Serapis was then standing in
that enterprising city, which had close commercial relations
with Egypt and the East. Soon after this date the earlier
temple of Isis at Pompeii must have been built.

<p>The entrance to the court of the temple (<a href="#fig078">Fig. 78</a>) is from the
north. Above the door is an inscription which informs us that
after an earthquake (that of the year 63) Numerius Popidius
Celsinus, at his own expense, rebuilt the temple of Isis from the
foundation, and that in recognition
of his generosity, though
he was only six years of age,
the members of the city council,
the decurions, admitted him
without cost to their rank:
<i>N[umerius] Popidius N[umerii]
f[ilius] Celsinus aedem
Isidis terrae motu conlapsam a
fundamento p[ecunia] s[ua]
restituit; hunc decuriones ob
liberalitatem, cum esset annorum
sexs, ordini suo gratis adlegerunt</i>.
The temple evidently
belonged to the city;
and the places for statues in
the court, as the inscriptions
show, were assigned by vote of
the city council.</p>

<p>Other inscriptions give information in regard to the family of
the child Celsinus. His father was Numerius Popidius Ampliatus,
his mother Corelia Celsa; a brother bore the same name as
the father. The real rebuilders were of course the parents; by
associating their munificence with the name of their son, they
opened the way for him to the city offices, for which the father,
a freedman, was not eligible. Ampliatus perpetuated his own
name by setting up a statue of Bacchus in a niche in the outside
of the rear wall of the temple (at <i>c</i> on the plan), with the inscription:
<i>N. Popidius Ampliatus pater p. s.</i>, 'Numerius Popidius
Ampliatus the father (set up this statue) at his own expense.'
The names of the two sons appear with that of their mother
in the mosaic floor of the large room (6) behind the colonnade
at the rear.</p>

<p>Though the rebuilding of Celsinus was 'from the foundation,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
remains of the old temple were utilized, as shafts of
columns and Corinthian capitals coated with white stucco; and
the plan of the new building was very nearly the same as that
of the old. The stylobate of the colonnade belongs to the
earlier structure, but the columns originally stood nearer together,
eight instead of seven at the ends, and ten on the sides.</p>

<p>The architectural forms and the workmanship of these remains
point to a time just after the founding of the Roman
colony; nevertheless the dimensions of the colonnade, approximately
fifty by sixty Oscan feet, reduce to the pre-Roman
standard of measurement, and the building may have been
commenced earlier. In later times the increasing number of
the worshippers of Isis made necessary an enlargement of the
sanctuary. The two rooms at the west end (5 and 6) were
added at the expense of the Palaestra, probably at the time
of the rebuilding.</p>

<p>In the middle of the court, which is surrounded by the colonnade,
is the temple, consisting of an oblong cella (2), the east
side of which is treated as a front, with a portico borne by six
columns (1). A pit for the refuse of sacrifices, enclosed by
a wall (<i>b</i>) stands in the corner of the court near the entrance
from the street; in the opposite corner there is a larger enclosure
having the appearance of a small temple (4). Near
this are two altars; a third altar stood close to the temple, and
there are five others, somewhat smaller, between the columns.
On the south side, between the colonnade and the Theatre, is
a small area of irregular shape, east of which is a dwelling
containing five rooms (7, 8, 9).</p>

<p>The accompanying illustrations show the temple as it is
to-day (<a href="#fig079">Fig. 79</a>) and as it was before the eruption (<a href="#fig080">Fig. 80</a>).
It has architecturally nothing suggestive of the Egyptian style.
Yet the plan presents a marked deviation from ordinary types,
as if the builders, erecting an edifice for the worship of foreign
gods, strove with set purpose to produce a bizarre effect; at the
right and the left of the front of the cella is a large niche, projecting
beyond the sides of the portico, and inorganically connected
with the main part of the temple by a pilaster. In the
ornamentation of this temple, as in that of the temple of Apollo,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
the simple and chaste forms of the Greek architecture were
replaced by gaudy stucco ornaments more in harmony with
the prevailing taste.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig079" id="fig079"></a>
<img src="images/fig079.jpg" width="540" height="406" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 79.&mdash;View of the temple of Isis.</p>
</div>

<p>Besides the broad flight of steps in front, a narrow stairway
at the left of the temple led to a side door opening into the
cella. A base of masonry about six feet high extends across
the rear of the cella, on which were two pedestals of tufa, about
sixteen inches square, for the statues of Isis and Osiris. In the
two large niches outside other divinities stood, perhaps Anubis
and Harpocrates. The latter was apparently worshipped also
at the shrine in the wall on the east side of the court (3), facing
the doorway of the cella. A painting from this shrine, now in
the Naples Museum, represents a statue of Harpocrates of the
familiar type&mdash;a boy with his finger in his mouth holding a
cornucopia, with a lotus blossom resting on his forehead; before
him stands a priest in a long white robe, holding a candlestick
in each hand, while in the background is a temple surrounded
by a colonnade, evidently intended for a free representation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
of the temple before us. In front of the shrine were the
charred remains of a wooden bench.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig080" id="fig080"></a>
<img src="images/fig080.jpg" width="541" height="369" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 80.&mdash;The temple of Isis, restored. In the background, the Large Theatre.</p>
</div>

<p>No statue was found in the cella or in the two niches in front.
We may suppose that the images of the four divinities, being
of relatively small size, were carried off by the priests at the
time of the eruption; had they been removed afterwards, the
excavators would have taken also the other objects in the cella
used in the services of the temple. Among these were two
skulls, probably made use of in the ceremonies attending initiation
into the Mysteries, and a marble hand, about four inches
long, but whether a right or a left hand, the journal of the
excavations does not say. A left hand was carried in the procession
in honor of Isis, described by Apuleius; as the weaker
of the two, and so less ready to do evil, it symbolized the even
justice (<i>aequitas</i>) with which the deity governs the world.
There were also two wooden caskets, one of which contained
a diminutive gold cup, measuring less than an inch across the
top, a glass vessel a trifle over an inch and a half in height, and
a statuette of a god about half as high; in the other were two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
bronze candlesticks about ten inches high, the use of which
may be inferred from the painting described above, and a
bronze lamp with places for two wicks.</p>

<p>The walls of the colonnade were painted in bright colors on
a deep red ground. The lower part of the columns was red,
but above they were white; the temple also was white, the
purpose obviously being to give the appearance of marble.
Nevertheless the same decorative framework appears both in
the white stucco of the temple and the painted decoration of
the colonnade: a division of the body of the wall into large
panels, with a continuous garland of conventional plant forms
above. In the colonnade there was a yellow base, treated as
a projecting architectural member; above it large red panels
alternated with light, fantastic architectural designs in yellow
on a red ground. The frieze was black, with garlands in strong
contrast&mdash;green, blue, and yellow&mdash;enlivened with all sorts
of animal forms. In the middle of each of the large panels
was a priest of Isis; in the lower part of the intervening architectural
designs were marine pictures,&mdash;galleys maneuvering,
and seafights. Similar pictures are found in other buildings,
as the Macellum, but marine views were especially appropriate
here, because Isis was a patron divinity of seamen. Apuleius
gives an interesting description of the spring festival, by which
the navigation of the opening season was committed to her
guardian care.</p>

<p>Opposite the entrance of the temple the colonnade presents
an interesting peculiarity of construction, which is found also in
other buildings at Pompeii, as the Stabian Baths. The place
of the three middle columns on that side is taken by two large
pillars, higher than the rest of the colonnade, each of which is
backed by an attached half-column. This arrangement made
the approach to the temple more imposing, and also furnished
an appropriate setting for the shrine of Harpocrates against
the wall.</p>

<p>The principal altar, on which sacrifice was offered to the
divinities worshipped in the temple, is that near the foot of
the steps in front (<i>e</i>). The officiating priest stood on a block
of stone at the side of it, with the temple at his right; on this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
altar were found ashes and fragments of calcined bones. The
two smaller altars near by were probably consecrated to the
gods whose images were placed in the exterior niches.</p>

<p>Two rectangular pits were used as receptacles for the refuse
of sacrifices. One was quite small, and no trace of it can now
be found; it was near the large altar, and contained remains of
burnt figs, pine kernels and cones, nuts, and dates, with fragments
of two statuettes representing divinities. The wall about
the other (<i>b</i>), when excavated, was built up at each end in the
form of a gable, and evidently once supported a wooden roof;
in this pit also were charred remains of fruits. What divinities
were worshipped at the altars between the columns, it is impossible
to determine. The small base standing against the corner
column near the entrance (seen in <a href="#fig079">Fig. 79</a>) was probably a
pedestal, not an altar.</p>

<p>At the left of the steps leading up to the temple, and facing
the large altar, is a small pillar of masonry fifteen inches square
and nearly two and a half feet high. A similar pillar, which
formerly stood at the right, had thin slabs of stone on three
sides. One of these, that on the front of the pillar (now in
the Naples Museum), was covered with hieroglyphics. It is
a memorial tablet, which Hat, 'the writer of the divine word,'
<i>hierogrammateus</i>, set up in honor of his parents and grandparents;
it contains symbolic representations in three divisions,
one above the other. In the upper division Hat, his brother
and colleague Meran, their father and grandfather, are praying
to Osiris, 'Lord of the Kingdom of the Dead'; below, Hat is
bringing to his parents and grandparents offerings for the dead,
while in the lower division Meran and two sisters unite with
him in prayer to Osiris. The tablet could hardly have been
designed for a temple, but still, by reason of its contents, it was
considered appropriate for this place. It was doubtless intended
that a similar tablet should be affixed to the pillar at
the left, but perhaps none happened to be available; statuettes
of divinities were probably placed on the pillars.</p>

<p>The presence of a statue of Bacchus in the niche in the rear wall
of the cella is easily explained; this divinity was identified with
Osiris. Two ears are moulded in the stucco beside the niche,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
symbolic of the listening of the god to the prayers of his worshippers.</p>

<p>Against the west wall of the colonnade, near the corners,
were two pedestals, with statues of female divinities about one
half life size. At the right was Isis, in archaic Greek costume,
with the inscription: <i>L. Caecilius Phoebus posuit l[oco] d[ato]
d[ecurionum] d[ecreto]</i>, 'Set up by Lucius Caecilius Phoebus,
in a place granted by a decree of the city council'; the
name indicates that the donor was a freedman. The other
statue, at the left, represents Venus drying her hair after the
bath; it is of a common type and possesses small value as a
work of art, yet is of interest because of the well preserved
painting and gilding. Venus, as many other goddesses, was
identified with Isis.</p>

<p>In the same corner with the statue of Venus, against the
south wall, stood the herm of Gaius Norbanus Sorex, a marble
pillar with a bronze head. According to the inscription, he was
an actor who played the second part (<i>secundarum, sc. partium</i>),
and was also magister of the suburb Pagus Augustus Felix.
He was probably a generous supporter of the temple. A duplicate
of the herm is found in the Eumachia building, to which
also he may have made a contribution. The low social standing
of the various benefactors of the temple is noteworthy; it
indicates in what circles the worship of the Egyptian divinities
found its adherents. As yet this was by no means an aristocratic
cult, although it became such later, especially after the
time of Hadrian.</p>

<p>While the Greek and Roman gods were honored chiefly at
their festivals, the Egyptian divinities demanded worship every
day, indeed several times a day. The early service, the 'opening
of the temple,' is described by Apuleius, who was probably
admitted to the college of the Servants of Isis in Rome in the
time of the Antonines, and wrote about 160 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> Before daybreak
the priest went into the temple by the side entrance and
threw back the great doors, which were fastened on the inside.
White linen curtains were hung across the doorway, shielding
the interior from view. Now the street gate of the court was
opened; the thronging multitude of the devout streamed in and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
took their places in front of the temple. The curtains were
drawn aside and the image of the goddess was presented to the
gaze of her worshippers, who greeted her with prayers and
shaking of the sistrum, a musical rattle, the use of which was
characteristic of the worship of the Egyptian gods. For a time
they remained sitting, engaged in prayer and in the contemplation
of the divinity; an hour after daybreak the service was
closed with an invocation to the newly risen sun. This description
throws light on the purpose of the bench in front of the
shrine of Harpocrates.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig081" id="fig081"></a>
<img src="images/fig081.jpg" width="536" height="532" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 81.&mdash;Scene from the worship of Isis&mdash;the adoration of the holy water. Wall
painting from Herculaneum.</p>
</div>

<p>The second service was held at two o'clock in the afternoon,
but we do not possess exact information in regard to it. It is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
perhaps, depicted in a fresco painting from Herculaneum (<a href="#fig081">Fig.
81</a>), the subject of which is a solemn act in the worship of Isis,
the adoration of the holy water. In the portico of the temple,
above the steps, two priests and a priestess are standing. The
priest in the middle holds in front of him, in the folds of his
robe, a vessel containing the holy water, which was supposed to
be from the Nile; his two associates are shaking the sistrum.
There is an altar at the foot of the steps; a priest is fanning
the fire into flame. On the right and the left of the altar
are the worshippers, with other priests, part of whom are shaking
the sistrum, while a fluteplayer sits in the foreground at
the right.</p>

<p>Another painting, the counterpart of that just described,
seems to portray the celebration of a festival; the surroundings
correspond fairly well with those of our temple. The doors are
thrown back; a dark-visaged man, wearing a wreath, is dancing
in the doorway. Behind him, within the temple, are the musicians,
among whom can be distinguished a girl striking the
cymbals and a woman with a tambourine. About the steps are
priests and other worshippers, shaking the sistrum and offering
prayer; in front stands a burning altar. An important festival
of Isis occurred in November. It commenced with an impassioned
lamentation over the death of Osiris and the search for
his body. On the third day, November 12, the finding of the
body by Isis was celebrated with great rejoicing. So, perhaps,
in this painting the dance is a manifestation of the joy with
which the festival ended, the whole picture being a scene from
the observance of the Egyptian Easter.</p>

<p>In such celebrations use would be made of the small brazier
of bronze found in the court in front of our temple, on which
incense could be burned. The ablutions, which played so
important a part in Egyptian rites, were performed in the rear
of the court, where stood a cylindrical leaden vessel, adorned
with Egyptian figures in relief; a jet fell into it from a lead
pipe connected with the city aqueduct.</p>

<p>The small building at the southeast corner of the court, which
is known as the Purgatorium, was open to the sky. It was
made to look like a roofed structure by the addition of gables
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
at the ends. On the inside, at the rear, a flight of steps leads
down toward the right to a vaulted underground chamber, about
five feet wide and six and a half feet long. The inner part of
the chamber, divided off by a low wall, was evidently intended
for a tank. In one of the corners in the front part is a low
base, on which a jar could be set while it was being filled.
Here the holy Nile water&mdash;more or less genuine&mdash;was kept
for use in the sacred rites.</p>

<p>The purpose of the tank is suggested by certain of the stucco
reliefs on the outside of the enclosing wall. In the gable, above
the entrance, is a vase, standing out from a blue ground, with a
kneeling figure on either side. The frieze contains Egyptian
priests and priestesses, also on
a blue ground, with their faces
turned toward the vessel (<a href="#fig082">Fig.
82</a>). The figures are all worshipping
the sacred water in
the vase.</p>

<div class="figright"><a name="fig082" id="fig082"></a>
<img src="images/fig082.jpg" width="275" height="453" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 82.&mdash;Part of the façade of the Purgatorium.</p>
</div>

<p>Of the other figures in relief,
only the two goddesses in the
panels at the sides of the entrance
have an Egyptian character.
Under each of them
was a small altar of tufa, attached
to the wall; the figure
at the left (<a href="#fig082">Fig. 82</a>) is plainly
Isis.</p>

<p>The side walls are decorated
with reliefs in Greco-Roman
style. They are divided into
a large middle panel, containing
two figures, and two side panels,
each with a Cupid. In the
middle panel, on the right side,
Mars and Venus are represented; in that at the left, Perseus
rescuing Andromeda (<a href="#fig083">Fig. 83</a>).</p>

<p>The dwelling back of the colonnade, on the south side, consists
of a kitchen (8), a dining room (7), a sleeping apartment (9),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
and two small rooms at the rear, under the stairway leading to
the highest seats of the Large Theatre. The ritual of the
Egyptian gods was so exacting, and the services of worship
were so numerous, that it was necessary for one or more priests
to reside within the precincts of the temple. These rooms were
the habitation of a priest.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig083" id="fig083"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 83.&mdash;Decoration of the east side of the Purgatorium&mdash;Perseus rescuing Andromeda.
At the right and the left floating Cupids, the one at the left bearing a box of incense.</p>
</div>

<p>One of the rooms on the west side (6) is oblong in shape,
with five broad, arched entrances opening from the colonnade.
The walls were richly decorated in the last Pompeian style.
There were seven large paintings, five of which were landscapes
with shrines, part being Egyptian landscapes; the other
two represent Io watched by Argus, with Hermes coming to
rescue her, and Io in Egypt, received by Isis. Against the rear
wall was a pedestal, on which probably stood the female figure,
above life size, the remains of which were found in one of the
entrances. Only the head, the hands, and the front parts of
the feet were of marble; the rest was of wood, no doubt concealed
by drapery. The priests seemingly had started to carry
the statue with them when they fled, but abandoned the attempt
at the doorway. In the same room a marble table, a sistrum,
two pots of terra cotta, three small glass bottles, and a glass
cup were found. We may safely conclude that here the common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
meals were served, of which, as we learn from Apuleius, the
devotees of the cult partook. And when, in connection with
the great festivals, the Mysteries were celebrated with a presentation
of the myth of Isis and Osiris in pantomime, this large
room was well adapted for the sacred exhibitions.</p>

<p>The adjoining room, at the southwest corner of the colonnade
(5), is irregular in shape and of an entirely different character.
It seems to have been regarded as a sacred place, and to have
been used for secret ceremonies. It was entered from the colonnade
by a narrow door, which could be securely fastened.
Large, sketchy pictures of gods were painted on the walls on a
white ground,&mdash;Isis, Osiris, Typhon,&mdash;with sacred animals
and symbols relating to the myth which to us are unintelligible.
The excavators found here the remains of four wooden statues
with marble heads, hands, and feet, one of a male figure, the
other three female; there were besides a statuette of an Egyptian
god made of green stone, on which were hieroglyphics; a
statuette of white clay, covered with a green glaze; a sphinx of
terra cotta, fragments of terra cotta statuettes of Egyptian
figures, different kinds of vessels of clay, glass, and lead, and a
bronze knife, evidently intended for use in sacrifices. At the
left near the entrance is a small reservoir, reached by three
steps. On the north side is a niche that apparently formed
part of a small shrine.</p>

<p>A kind of alcove opens off from the southeast corner of this
room, the entrance to which could be closed by a curtain. From
this a few steps and a door led into a storeroom, in which were
found about three dozen vessels of various shapes, an iron tripod,
and no less than fifty-eight earthen lamps. The lamps were in
part provided with iron rings, so that they could be suspended;
there were also iron rods, which the excavators supposed to
be lamp holders. A rear door connected the storeroom with
the small area of irregular shape between the Palaestra and the
Theatre.</p>

<p>These arrangements suggest the celebration of secret rites
by night; we may well believe that novices were here initiated
into the order of the Servants of Isis. Obscure hints in regard
to the ceremonies connected with the consecration to the service
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
of the goddess are thrown out by Apuleius. 'The initiation,'
said the priest to him, 'is conducted under the image of
a voluntary death, with the renewing of life as a gift from the
deity.' Of his own experience he says merely: 'I came to
the borders of death, I trod the threshold of Proserpina, then
came back through all the stages to life. In the middle of the
night I saw the sun shine brightly; I entered into the immediate
presence of the gods above and the gods below, and worshipped
them face to face.'</p>

<p>Renunciation of past life, and a second birth to a new and
purified existence, were the main ideas underlying the ceremonies,
which as presented here must have been far less
splendid and impressive than in Rome, where they were
witnessed by Apuleius.

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE TEMPLE OF ZEUS MILICHIUS</i></span></h3>

<p>The small temple near the northeast corner of the block containing
the theatres is entered from Stabian Street. The court
(<a href="#fig084">Fig. 84</a>, 2), like that of the temple of Vespasian, has a colonnade
across the front; only the foundation
and a Doric capital of lava are
preserved.</p>

<li>2. Court, with large altar.</li>
<li>3. Cella.</li>
<li>4. Sacristan's room.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>At the end of the colonnade on
the right is the room of the sacristan
(4). The large altar (<a href="#fig251">Fig. 251</a>)
stands close to the foot of the steps
leading up to the temple. It is
built of blocks of tufa, with a frieze
of triglyphs and panels like those
found on walls in the first style of decoration.</p>

<p>The steps extend across the front of the temple, the unusual
elevation of which is explained by the inequality of the ground.
Of the six columns in the tetrastyle portico no remains have
been found, but three capitals of pilasters are preserved, two
belonging to those at the corners of the cella, and one, considerably
smaller, to a doorpost; they are of tufa, and were once
covered with white stucco.</p>

<p>The excellent proportions and fine workmanship of the capitals
point to the period of the first style of decoration; there
was formerly a remnant of that style on the north wall of the
cella, copied before 1837. Nevertheless the quasi-reticulate
masonry of the cella, closely resembling that of the Small
Theatre, dates from the early years of the Roman colony. In
this period the temple in its present form was built, perhaps
with the help of native Pompeian masons.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<p>Attached to the rear wall of the cella was an oblong pedestal
on which were placed two statues, representing Jupiter and
Juno, together with a bust of Minerva, all of terra cotta and of
poor workmanship. The suggestion at once presents itself that
this was the Capitolium, erected by the Roman colonists soon
after they settled in Pompeii. It is incredible, however, that
colonists who had the means to erect monumental buildings,
such as the Amphitheatre and the Small Theatre, should have
housed the great gods of the Capitol in so modest a temple,
in so inconspicuous a spot, and should not have provided more
costly images.</p>

<p>All the evidence is in favor of the explanation, already
proposed (<a href="#Page_66">p. 66</a>), that after the earthquake the worship of
the gods of the Capitol was
transferred hither temporarily
from the temple in the Forum,
until that should be rebuilt.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;"><a name="fig085" id="fig085"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 85.&mdash;Capital of pilaster with the

</div>

<p>What divinity thus became
the host of the Roman gods?
It would be impossible to say
but for the fortunate recovery
of an Oscan inscription, which
was set up in the passage of
the Stabian Gate. This commemorates
the work of two
aediles, M. Sittius and N. Pontius, who improved the street
leading out from the Stabian Gate 'as far as the Stabian
Bridge, and the Via Pompeiana as far as the temple of Zeus
Milichius; these streets, as well as the Via Jovia (and another,
the name of which cannot be made out) they placed in perfect
repair.'</p>

<p>It is natural to suppose that the Via Pompeiana, mentioned
in immediate connection with the road leading to Stabiae, was
the continuation of the latter within the city, or Stabian Street.
This, then, led to the temple named in the inscription, and as
there is no other temple on the street, the small sanctuary in
which the images of the Capitoline divinities were placed was
the temple of Zeus Milichius.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span></p>

<p>This building, however, is not old enough to have been mentioned
in an Oscan inscription. It probably stands in the place
of a much earlier edifice. The masonry of the wall on the south
side of the court is different from that of the other walls, and
older; as it shows no trace of a cross wall, it must always have
stood at the side of an open space, such as that of the present
court. To the earlier building the capitals belong, the style of
which, as remarked above, is pre-Roman.</p>

<p>In view of this explanation, we should probably recognize in
the head carved on the smallest of the pilaster capitals (<a href="#fig085">Fig. 85</a>)
a representation of Zeus Milichius, a divinity honored in many
parts of Greece, especially by the farmers; Zeus the Gracious,
the patron of tillers of the soil. The serious, kindly face, bearded
and with long locks, was more than a mere ornament; it was the
god himself looking down upon the worshipper who entered his
sanctuary. As a representation of Zeus it probably exemplifies
an ancient type.

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE BATHS AT POMPEII.&mdash;THE STABIAN BATHS</i></span></h3>

<p>In comparison with the great bathing establishments of
Rome, the baths at Pompeii are of moderate size. They have,
however, a special interest, due in part to their excellent preservation,
in part to the certainty with which the purpose of the
various rooms can be determined; and their remains enable
us to trace the development of the public bath in a single city
during a period of almost two hundred years. From this
source, moreover, most of our knowledge of the arrangements
of the ancient bath is derived, without which the imposing but
barren remains of Rome itself would be for the most part unintelligible.
It is not easy for one living under present conditions
to understand how important a place the baths occupied in the
life of antiquity, particularly of the Romans under the Empire;
they offered, within a single enclosure, opportunities for physical
care and comfort and leisurely intercourse with others, not
unlike those afforded in the cities of modern Europe by the
club, the café, and the promenade.</p>

<p>Though the Roman baths differed greatly in size and in
details of arrangement, the essential parts were everywhere
the same. First there was a court, <i>palaestra</i>, surrounded by
a colonnade. This was devoted to gymnastic exercises, and connected
with it in most cases was an open-air swimming tank.
The dressing room, <i>apodyterium</i>, was usually entered from the
court through a passageway or anteroom. A basin for cold
baths was sometimes placed in the dressing room; in large
establishments a separate apartment was set aside for this purpose,
the <i>frigidarium</i>. To avoid too sudden a change of temperature
for the bathers, a room moderately heated, <i>tepidarium</i>,
was placed between the dressing room and the <i>caldarium</i>, in
which hot baths were given. At one end of the caldarium was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
a bath basin of masonry, <i>alveus</i>; at the other was ordinarily
a semicircular niche, <i>schola</i>, in which stood the <i>labrum</i>, a large,
shallow, circular vessel resting upon a support of masonry, and
supplied with lukewarm water by a pipe leading from a tank
back of the furnace. The more extensive establishments, as
the Central Baths at Pompeii, contained also a round room,
called <i>Laconicum</i> from its Spartan origin, for sweating baths
in dry air. In describing baths it is more convenient to use the
ancient names.</p>

<p>In earlier times the rooms were heated by means of braziers,
and in one of the Pompeian baths the tepidarium was warmed
in this way to the last. A more satisfactory method was
devised near the beginning of the first century <span class="s08">B.C.</span> by Sergius
Orata, a famous epicure, whose surname is said to have been
given to him because of his fondness for golden trout (<i>auratae</i>).
He was the first to plant artificial oyster beds in the Lucrine
Lake, and the experiment was so successful that he derived a
large income from them; we may assume that he turned an
honest penny also by his invention of the 'hanging baths,'
<i>balneae pensiles</i>, with which his name has ever since been associated.
These were built with a hollow space under the floor,
the space being secured by making the floor of tiles, two feet
square, supported at the corners by small brick pillars (<a href="#fig088">Fig. 88</a>);
into this space hot air was introduced from the furnace, and as
the floor became warm, the temperature of the room above was
evenly modified.</p>

<p>This improved method of heating was not long restricted to
the floors. As early as the Republican period, the hollow space
was extended to the walls by means of small quadrangular
flues and by the use of nipple tiles, <i>tegulae mammatae</i>, large
rectangular tiles with conical projections, about two inches
high, at each corner; these were laid on their edges, with the
projections pressed against the wall, thus leaving an air space
on the inside.</p>

<p>In bathing establishments designed for both men and women,
the two caldariums were placed near together. There was
a single furnace, <i>hypocausis</i>, where the water for the baths was
warmed; from this also hot air was conveyed through broad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
flues under the floors of both caldariums, thence circulating
through the walls. Through similar flues underneath, the warm
air, already considerably cooled, was conveyed from the hollow
spaces of the caldariums into those of the tepidariums. In
order to maintain a draft strong enough to draw the hot air
from the furnace under the floors, the air spaces of the walls
had vents above, remains of which may still be seen in some
baths. These vents were no doubt sufficient to keep up the
draft after the rooms had once been heated; but in order to
warm them at the outset a draft fire was needed,&mdash;that is, a small
fire under the floor at some point a considerable distance from
the furnace and near the vents, through which it would cause
the escape of warm air, and so start a hot current from the
furnace. The place of the draft fire has been found under two
rooms of the Pompeian baths; and a similar arrangement has
been noted in the case of Roman baths excavated in Germany.</p>

<p>The use of the baths varied according to individual taste and
medical advice. In general, however, bathers availed themselves
of one of three methods.</p>

<p>The most common form of the bath was that taken after
exercise in the palaestra,&mdash;ball playing was a favorite means of
exercise,&mdash;use being made of all the rooms. The bather undressed
in the apodyterium, or perhaps in the tepidarium,
where he was rubbed with unguents; then he took a sweat in
the caldarium, following it with a warm bath. Returning to
the apodyterium, he gave himself a cold bath either in this
room or in the frigidarium; he then passed into the Laconicum,
or, if there was no Laconicum, went back into the caldarium for
a second sweat; lastly, before going out, he was thoroughly
rubbed with unguents, as a safeguard against taking cold.</p>

<p>Some bathers omitted the warm bath. They passed through
the tepidarium directly into the Laconicum or caldarium, where
they had a sweat; they then took a cold bath, or had cold water
poured over them, and were rubbed with unguents.</p>

<p>In the simplest form of the bath the main rooms were not
used at all. The bathers heated themselves with exercise in
the palaestra, then removed the dirt and oil with scrapers,
<i>strigiles</i>, and bathed in the swimming tank.

<p class="caption">PLATE V.&mdash;APODYTERIUM OF THE STABIAN BATHS, WITH THE ANTEROOM LEADING
FROM THE PALAESTRA</p>
</div>

<p>Up to the present time three public baths have been excavated
in Pompeii, two for both men and women, one for men only.
Besides these there are two private establishments in the eighth
Region (VIII. ii. 17 and 23), one perhaps for men, the other for
women; and another, apparently for men, was discovered in the
eighteenth century near the Amphitheatre and covered up again,
being a part of the villa of Julia Felix. It is quite possible that
two or three more bathing establishments yet await excavation;
one at least, connected with a warm spring, is known to us from
an inscription&mdash;that of M. Crassus Frugi. About a dozen
houses also contain complete baths for private use.</p>

<p class="p2">The largest and oldest bathing establishment at Pompeii is
that to which the name Stabian Baths has been given, from its
location on Stabian Street. It was built in the second century
<span class="s08">B.C.</span>, but was remodelled in the early days of the Roman colony,
and afterwards underwent extensive repairs. It is of irregular
shape, and occupies a large part of a block, having streets on
three sides; on the north side it is bounded by the house of
Siricus. Opening upon two of the streets are shops, which
have nothing to do with the baths and are not numbered on the
plan (<a href="#fig086">Fig. 86</a>).</p>

<p>Entering from the south through the broad doorway at A, we
find ourselves in the palaestra, C, which has a colonnade on three
sides. On the west side the place of the colonnade is taken by
a strip of smooth pavement with a raised margin; two heavy
stone balls were found here, which were obviously used in a
game resembling the modern ninepins; at the further end is
the room for the players, K. Close to the bowling course, at
the middle of the west side, is the swimming tank, F, with
rooms (E, G) adjoining it at either end. At the corner near
the further room, G, is a side entrance, L; J is the office
of the director or superintendent in charge of the building.</p>

<p>On the east side of the court are the men's baths, rooms I-VIII;
north of these are the women's baths, rooms 1-6, with
the furnace room, IX, between them. In the northwest corner
of the building were small rooms (<i>e-e</i>) intended for private
baths. They had not been provided with the improved heating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
arrangements, and were not in use at the time of the catastrophe.
The larger room adjoining (<i>k</i>) was a closet.</p>

<p>The anteroom of the men's baths (IV), opens at one end into
the dressing room or apodyterium (VI), as seen in <a href="#plate05">Plate V</a>. It
has a vaulted ceiling, richly decorated. A door at the left leads
into the frigidarium (V),
and another at the right
into a servants' waiting
room (I), which is accessible
from the court.
This room was formerly
entered also from the
street, through a passage
(III), which was later
closed; on one side of
it is a bench of masonry
for the slaves in attendance
upon their masters.
Similar benches are
found in the waiting
room at the other end
of the apodyterium (X).</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p>The apodyterium also
was provided with
benches of the same sort,
as indicated on the plan; they are shown in <a href="#plate05">Plate V</a>. Along the
walls at the sides, just under the edge of the vaulted ceiling, was
a row of small niches, the use of which corresponded with that
of the lockers in a modern gymnasium. These niches are about
5¾ feet above the floor, while those in the other dressing room
(2) are a little less than five feet; from this difference in height
it has been rightly inferred that the smaller and simpler division
of the baths was set aside for women. The floor is paved with
rectangular flags of gray marble, with blocks of basalt next to
the walls. While the walls were left simply white, with a red
base, the ceiling was elaborately decorated with stucco reliefs in
the style prevalent shortly before the destruction of the city;
there are vestiges of similar decoration in the tepidarium. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
octagonal, hexagonal, and quadrangular panels are rosettes,
Cupids, trophies, and bacchic figures. The lunettes are adorned
with fantastic architectural designs, in which we see bacchic
figures standing on pedestals, and Cupids riding on dolphins;
the sides of the two arches supporting the ceiling (one of them
is seen in <a href="#plate05">Plate V</a>) are decorated with female figures mounted
on dolphins, which run out into arabesques. The frequent suggestion
of water in these motives is in harmony with the purpose
of the room.</p>

<p>Even more effective is the decoration of the small round frigidarium.
Light is admitted, as in the Pantheon at Rome, through
a round hole in the
apex of the domed
ceiling. At the edge
of the circular bath
basin, lined with white
marble, was a narrow
strip of marble floor,
which is extended into
the four semicircular
niches. Wall and
niches alike are
painted to represent
a beautiful garden,
with a blue sky above
(<a href="#fig087">Fig. 87</a>). The eye
wanders among trees and shrubs, catching glimpses of birds
overhead, of statues and vases here and there in the midst of
the green foliage, and of jets of water falling into circular basins.
The blue dome is studded with stars. The bather could scarcely
feel the narrowness of a room, the decoration of which was so
suggestive of expanse and open air. A jet of water fell into
the basin from a small niche in the upper part of the wall; and
the place of the overflow pipe may be easily recognized.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;"><a name="fig087" id="fig087"></a>
<img src="images/fig087.jpg" width="346" height="268" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 87.&mdash;Stabian Baths: interior of the frigidarium,
restored.</p>
</div>

<p>The tepidarium (VII) and caldarium (VIII) were heated by
means of hollow floors and walls. The former is much the
smaller, as we should have expected from its use as an intermediate
room, in which the bathers would ordinarily not tarry so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
long as in the caldarium. The large bath basin at the east end
(indicated on the plan) is unusual; it was seemingly a later
addition, and was probably made to accommodate those who in
the winter shrank from using the frigidarium, but wished nevertheless
to take a moderately cold bath. Near the bottom of the
wall back of this basin, a hole had been made so that underneath
a fire could be kindled from the outside (in X), not in order to
heat the basin, which could be supplied with warm water by
means of a pipe, but to start the circulation of hot air from the
furnace; at the top of the wall above were two vents opening
from the warm air chamber. There was a place for another
draft fire under the women's caldarium.</p>

<p>One of the fragments of stucco relief still remaining in the
tepidarium presents the figure of a man reading from a roll of
manuscript. It suggests the standing complaint of the ancients
in regard to the trials of bathers, who could not escape the ever-present
poet declaiming his latest production.</p>

<p>At one end of the caldarium we find the bath basin, alveus;
at the other is the support of the labrum, which has disappeared.
In the niche above the latter are two vents for the draft, and
above the niche was a round window. This room, as most of the
others, was dimly lighted. The little round window of the anteroom
is shown in our plate. There were two similar windows
in the lunette of the apodyterium, above the roof of the anteroom;
they are not seen in our plate, having at one time been entirely
covered up by the construction of a wall to support the
roof. A similar window was very likely placed at the end of
the tepidarium, over the roof of the frigidarium; and perhaps
these were supplemented by holes in the crown of the arched
ceilings, as in the women's apodyterium.</p>

<p>The women's baths are entered from the court through a long
anteroom (6); the dressing room is connected also with the two
side streets by means of corridors (1, 5). Originally there was no
communication between the women's baths and the palaestra.</p>

<p>The apodyterium (2) is the best preserved room of the entire
building, and also the most ancient. It shows almost no traces
of the catastrophe. The vaulted ceiling is intact. The smooth,
white stucco on the walls and the simple cornice at the base of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
the lunettes date from the time of the first builders. Now, as
then, light is admitted only through two small openings in the
crown of the vault and a window in the west lunette. To a
modern visitor the interior seems gloomy. The pavement, of
lozenge-shaped, reddish glazed tiles, belongs to the same early
period. There is a strip of basaltic flags connecting the door
of one of the corridors (1) with that of the tepidarium. This
much travelled path seems to indicate that many ladies&mdash;particularly,
we may assume, in the winter&mdash;went at once into the
more comfortable tepidarium without stopping in the dressing
room. Along the walls were benches, and above them niches,
as in the men's apodyterium. In the time of the Empire the
fronts of the niches, finely carved in tufa, were overlaid with a
thick coating of stucco, the upper part being ornamented with
designs in relief.</p>

<p>The women had no frigidarium. A large basin for cold baths
was built at the west end of the dressing room, but this also is
a later addition; before it was made, those who wished for cold
baths must have contented themselves with portable bath tubs.</p>

<p>The tepidarium (3) and caldarium (4) are in a better state of
preservation than those of the men's baths, which they so closely
resemble in all their arrangements that a detailed description is
unnecessary. In their present form they are not so ancient as
the apodyterium, and the decoration is less elaborate than that
of the corresponding rooms on the other side.</p>

<p>The labrum is intact, a round, shallow basin of white marble
resting on a support of masonry; it has here no separate niche.
The bath basin in the caldarium also retains its veneering of
white marble, with an overflow pipe of bronze at the upper
edge; it is about two feet deep. In such basins the bathers
leaned against the sloping back, which for this reason was
called a cushion (<i>pulvinus</i>) by Vitruvius. This alveus would
accommodate eight bathers, that in the men's caldarium perhaps
ten. Places were probably assigned in numerical order,
each bather awaiting his turn. Those who did not wish
to wait, or preferred to bathe by themselves, might use individual
bath tubs of bronze. Remains of such a tub, as well as
of bronze benches, were found in this room. Near the bottom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
of the alveus in front is an opening, through which the water
could be let out; when it was emptied, the water ran over the
white mosaic floor, which was thus cleaned.</p>

<p>In the time of the Early Empire it became the fashion to bathe
with very warm water. 'People want to be parboiled,' Seneca
exclaims. The construction of the alveus, however, was not well
adapted to conserve the heat, and an ingenious contrivance was
devised to remedy the difficulty, which may best be explained with
the help of our illustration, showing the arrangement of the bath
basin in room 4 (<a href="#fig088">Fig. 88</a>). A large hot air flue, D, led directly
from the furnace to the hollow space, C, under the alveus, A.
Above this flue was a long bronze heater, B, in the form of a
half cylinder, with one end opening into the end of the alveus.
As the bottom of the heater was six inches lower than that of
the alveus, the cooler water from the basin would flow down
into it and be heated again, a circulation being thus maintained.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p>A similar arrangement (called <i>testudo alvei</i> by Vitruvius)
probably existed for the alveus in the caldarium on the other
side; but that part of the men's baths has been destroyed.
Only one other heater of this kind has been found,&mdash;and that
much smaller,&mdash;in a villa near Boscoreale, recently excavated; but
the semicircular opening made for the heater above the hot air
flue may be seen in the Central Baths, in a private establishment
at Pompeii, and generally in the remains of Roman baths.</p>

<p>In the furnace room (<i>praefurnium</i>, IX) between the two caldariums,
stood three large cylindrical tanks. They have disappeared,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
but their outlines can still be seen in the masonry of
the foundations, and are shown in our plan. The one furthest
east was for hot water. It was directly over the fire, and connected
with the bath basins of the two caldariums. The next,
for lukewarm water, stood over a hollow space opening into the
furnace. A lead pipe leading from it to the labrum of the
women's caldarium is still to be seen; the water bubbled up in
the middle of the labrum. The third and largest reservoir, for
cold water, was placed on a foundation of solid masonry.</p>

<p>The more important alterations made in the baths during the
two centuries that they were in use had to do with the arrangements
for heating, and may briefly be considered here before
we proceed to another part of the building. It will be best not
to weary the reader with details, but to present a brief summary
of conclusions, which will perhaps be found of interest,
not only as casting light on the gradual development of these
baths, but also as illustrating that adjustment of public buildings
to the needs and tastes of successive generations, which
was as characteristic of ancient as it is of modern life.</p>

<p>For the extensive changes made in the earlier part of the
first century B.C. we have the evidence of an inscription, which
had been cast aside and was found in one of the smaller rooms.
It reads, <i>C. Uulius C. f., P. Aninius C. f., II v. i. d., Laconicum
et destrictarium faciund. et porticus et palaestr[am] reficiunda
locarunt ex d[ecurionum] d[ecreto] ex ea pequnia quod eos e lege in
ludos aut in monumento consumere oportuit faciun[da] coerarunt
eidemque probaru[nt]</i>. The form of the letters and the spelling
point to the time of Sulla as the period in which the inscription
was cut. The syntax is confused, but the meaning is clear:
a Laconicum and <i>destrictarium</i> were built, the colonnade and
palæstra repaired, by the duumvirs Gaius Ulius and Publius
Aninius, in accordance with a vote of the city council; and they
furnished the means for this work in fulfilment of their obligation,
incurred by the acceptance of the duumviral office, to
spend a certain sum upon either games or buildings.</p>

<p>The destrictarium&mdash;a room for removing dirt and oil with
the strigil after gymnastic exercises&mdash;is easily identified (D),
as are also the palaestra and colonnade; but in our survey of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
the baths, we have found no separate chamber to which the
term Laconicum could properly be applied. In order to arrive
at a solution of the difficulty, we must note the successive steps
by which, as shown by an examination of the remains of the
masonry, the heating arrangements were extended and improved.</p>

<p>At first, in the Baths as originally constructed, there were
neither hollow walls nor hollow floors. The heating was done
by means of braziers; and there were niches or lockers in the
walls of the caldariums and tepidariums similar to those now
found in the dressing rooms, but in double rows, the upper
niches being larger, the lower smaller.</p>

<p>Later, a hollow floor was built in the men's caldarium. Later
still, this room was provided with hollow walls, which were
extended to the crown of the ceilings and the lunettes, the
tepidarium being still heated with braziers.</p>

<p>Finally, a hollow floor and hollow walls were constructed at
the same time in the men's tepidarium, but the hot air chamber
was not carried up into the ceiling or the lunettes.</p>

<p>A similar transformation was gradually accomplished in the
women's apartments; but owing, it would seem, to a desire for
greater warmth in the tepidarium, the hot air chamber here, as
in the caldarium, was extended to the lunettes and the ceiling.</p>

<p>Since the method of heating by means of hollow floors only
came into vogue about 100 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, and since the duumvirate of
Ulius and Aninius must have occurred soon after 80 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, we
are probably safe in supposing that they built the hollow floors
of the two caldariums, and that the new heating arrangement
was loosely called a Laconicum. At least a partial warrant for
this interpretation is found in a passage of Dion Cassius
(LIII. xxvii. 1), in which he says that Agrippa built the 'Spartan
sweating bath,' <span class="greek" title="to pyriatêrion to Lakônikon">τὸ πυριατήριον τὸ Λακωνικόν</span>. Agrippa,
however, built, not a Laconicum in the narrow sense, but a complete
bathing establishment, and Dion, doubtless following some
earlier writer, uses the word as generally applicable to a system
of warm baths. In default of a better explanation, we must
accept a meaning equally loose for our inscription.</p>

<p>It is not possible to date, even approximately, the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
changes by which the baths were conformed to the increasing
desire for warmth and comfort; but the decoration of the
greater part of the building, with its complicated designs and
stucco reliefs, was clearly applied to the walls not many decades
before the destruction of the city.</p>

<p>The unroofed swimming tank, F, was separated from the
court by a barrier of masonry about two feet high, which was
extended also in front of the rooms at the ends, E and G. On
either side was a step, both the steps and the barrier being
veneered with white marble. The tank was supplied by a pipe
entering from the northeast; the overflow pipe, at the southeast
corner, is indicated on the plan.</p>

<p>The rooms E and G, opening both on the swimming tank
and on the court with high arched doorways, were roofed
shallow basins where the athletes could give themselves a preliminary
cleaning before going into the tank. The walls are
veneered with marble to a height of 6½ feet; above are painted
plants, birds, statues, and nymphs, one of whom holds a shell
to catch a jet of water; over these the blue sky. Here, as in
the frigidarium, the artist strove to convey the impression of
being in the open air, in a beautiful garden, adorned with sculptures.
A jet of water spurted from the rear wall just above the
marble dado; above it is a large oblong niche, apparently for
a statue.</p>

<p>After a time the basin in G was filled up, and covered with a
mosaic floor of the same height as the threshold; when one
cleaning room was found to be adequate, that was retained
which had a separate dressing room, D. On the white walls of
the dressing room are traces of the wooden wardrobes that once
stood against them. In this room, the destrictarium, the athletes
disrobed, and rubbed themselves with oil before engaging in
gymnastic exercises, and to it they returned from the palaestra,
in order to scrape themselves (<i>se destringere</i>); then they washed
themselves in the next room, E, and finally plunged into the tank.</p>

<p>The room of the official in charge of the baths, J, had windows
opening on the court and into the bowlers' room, K. A
large bronze brazier was found here, presented, according to
an inscription on it, by Marcus Nigidius Vaccula, who, as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
symbol of his name, had the figure of a cow (<i>vacca</i>) stamped
in relief on the brazier. We find a similar brazier, together
with benches, in the tepidarium of the baths near the Forum,
which had no other means of heating; we naturally infer that
the furniture here was intended for one of the tepidariums, and
used there before the improved method of heating was introduced.
A Nasennius Nigidius Vaccula, who died before 54
<span class="s08">A.D.</span>, is known to us from the receipts of Caecilius Jucundus.
If he was the donor, and made the gift when he was a young
man, the change of the system of heating in the tepidarium
may have been made as early as 20 <span class="s08">A.D.</span></p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 89.&mdash;Colonnade of the Stabian Baths: capital
with section of entablature, restored.</p>
</div>

<p>The colonnade was originally uniform on all the three sides.
The Doric columns were of tufa, coated with fine white stucco.
They were of slender
proportions, the height
being a trifle over nine
feet, with a diameter of
only sixteen inches.
They were edged, not
fluted, and doubtless carried
an entablature with
triglyphs, of which no
trace remains. In the
time of the Empire,
apparently before the
earthquake of 63, the
colonnade was remodelled
in accordance with the prevailing taste. The columns received
a thick coating of stucco, with flutings indicated by incised
lines; the lower third of the shaft was painted red, the
upper portion being left white. Over the capitals, moulded
in stucco, was an entablature resting on thick planks, and ornamented
with light-colored stucco reliefs. The general effect may
be seen from our illustration (<a href="#fig089">Fig. 89</a>).</p>

<p>In this reconstruction the sameness of the earlier colonnade
was varied with pleasing irregularities. Thus in front of the
main entrance (A), and in a corresponding position on the
opposite side of the court, the place of four columns was taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
by two broad pillars flanked by half-columns, and carrying a
roof more than five feet higher than that of the rest of the
colonnade. A similar arrangement has already been noted in
the colonnade of the temple of Isis <a href="#Page_174">(p. 174</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig090" id="fig090"></a>
<img src="images/fig090.jpg" width="531" height="402" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 90.&mdash;Stabian Baths: southwest corner of the palaestra, showing part of the colonnade
and wall decorated with stucco reliefs.</p>
</div>

<p>The wall decoration of the court has been particularly well
preserved on the outer wall of D and E (<a href="#fig090">Fig. 90</a>; cf. <a href="#plate13">Pl. XIII</a>).
The surface is diversified by fantastic architectural designs in
two stories, made up of slender columns with their entablatures,
open doorways with steps leading up to them, and glimpses of
interiors. In the panels thus outlined, figures of all kinds stand
out in white relief on a bright red or blue ground. Above the
arched doorway Jupiter sits, resting his right hand on his
sceptre; near by, on a pillar, is the eagle. Further to the left
a satyr offers Hercules a drinking horn. Another relief, not so
well preserved, has a motive suggestive of the purpose of the
building&mdash;Hylas at the spring seized by the nymphs. With
this we may associate two designs having reference to the exercises
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
of the palaestra: a boxer, at the left of the doorway of E,
and at the right a man scraping himself with a strigil. On
the outer wall of G is Daedalus, making wings for himself and
Icarus.</p>

<p>Under the colonnade at the rear, a herm stands close to the
wall, having the features of a youth with a garment drawn over
his head and covering the upper part of the body. For the
explanation of it we are indebted to Pausanias. 'In the gymnasium
at Phigalia, in Arcadia,' says this writer, 'is an image
of Hermes. It has the appearance of a man wrapped in a
cloak, and terminates below in a square pillar in the place of
feet.' This is Hermes, the god of the Palaestra, here, as in
Phigalia, in a guise suggestive of his function of Psychopompus,
the conductor of departed souls. We have already met with
an example of the same type in the court of the temple of
Apollo.</p>

<p>A sundial stood on the roof of the frigidarium and men's
caldarium, supported by a foundation of masonry still visible.
It bore an Oscan inscription, from which we learn that it was
set up by the Quaestor Maras Atinius, in accordance with a
decree of the council, the money for the expenditure being
derived from fines. The fines were very likely collected here,
by the official in charge of the building. Sundials were erected
also in the other baths at Pompeii. They were a necessity, for
all such establishments were conducted on a schedule of hours.
Hadrian ordered that the baths in Rome should be open from
the eighth hour, that is, after two o'clock in the afternoon; and
a regulation in regard to the time of opening, if not of closing,
was probably in force at Pompeii.</p>

<p>A motley and tumultuous life once filled the barren court, the
rooms now ruined and deserted. The scene is well pictured by
Seneca (Ep. 56): 'Quiet is by no means so necessary for study
as men commonly believe,' the philosopher gravely argues.
'I am living near a bath: sounds are heard on all sides. Just
imagine for yourself every conceivable kind of noise that can
offend the ear. The men of more sturdy muscle go through
their exercises, and swing their hands heavily weighted with
lead: I hear their groans when they strain themselves, or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
whistling of labored breath when they breathe out after having
held in. If one is rather lazy, and merely has himself rubbed
with unguents, I hear the blows of the hand slapping his shoulders,
the sound varying according as the massagist strikes with
flat or hollow palm. If a ballplayer begins to play and to
count his throws, it's all up for the time being. Meanwhile
there is a sudden brawl, or a thief is caught, or there is some
one in the bath who loves to hear the sound of his own voice;
and the bathers plunge into the swimming tank with loud
splashing. These noises, however, are not without some semblance
of excuse; but the hair plucker from time to time raises
his thin, shrill voice in order to attract attention, and is only
still himself when he is forcing cries of pain from some one
else, from whose armpits he plucks the hairs. And above the
din you hear the shouts of those who are selling cakes, sausages,
and sweetmeats, besides all the hawkers of stuff from the cookshops,
each with a different and characteristic cry.'</p>

<p>Such were the distractions of a Roman bath.

<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE BATHS NEAR THE FORUM</i></span></h3>

<p>The bathing establishment in the block north of the Forum
is smaller and simpler in its arrangements than that described
in the last chapter, but the parts are essentially the same. Here
also we find a court, with a colonnade on three sides; a system
of baths for men,
comprising a dressing
room (I) with a
small round frigidarium
(II) opening off
from it, a tepidarium
(III), and a caldarium
(IV); a similar system
for women, the place
of the frigidarium being
taken by a tank for
cold baths (2) in the
dressing room; and a
long narrow furnace
room between the two
baths (V). On three
sides of the establishment
are shops, in
connection with which
are several inns.</p>

</div>

<p>These baths were
built shortly after 80 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, about the time that Ulius and Aninius
repaired the Stabian Baths; the characteristic masonry,
with quasi-reticulate facing, is similar to that of the Small
Theatre and the Amphitheatre. The names of the builders
are known from an inscription found in duplicate:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
<i>L. Caesius
C. f. d[uum] v[ir] i[uri] d[icundo], C. Occius M. f., L. Niraemius
A. f. II v[iri] d[e] d[ecurionum] s[ententia] ex
peq[unia] publ[ica] fac[iundum] curar[unt] prob[arunt]
q[ue]</i>. Thus we see that the contract for the building was
let and the work approved by Lucius Caesius, duumvir with
judiciary authority,&mdash;his colleague had probably died since
election and the vacancy had not yet been filled,&mdash;and the two
aediles, Occius and Niraemius, who are here styled 'duumvirs,'
for reasons already explained (<a href="#Page_12">p. 12</a>); the cost was defrayed
by an appropriation from the public treasury. Though these
Baths are of later construction than the Stabian Baths, they
seem more ancient because fewer changes were made in them.</p>

<p>The court here was not a palaestra; it was small for gymnastic
exercises, and was not provided with a swimming tank
and dressing rooms. The open space was occupied by a garden.</p>

<p>The colonnade on the north and west sides of the court had
slender columns standing far apart, with a low and simple
entablature; on the east side the columns were replaced by
pillars carrying low arches, which served as a support for
a gallery affording a pleasant view of the garden. This
gallery was accessible from the upper rooms of several
inns along the street leading north from the Forum, whose
guests no doubt found diversion in watching what was going
on below&mdash;an advantage that may have been taken into
account by the city officials in fixing the rent. There are
benches on the north side of the court, and at the middle a
deep recess, or exedra (<i>b</i>), making a pleasant retreat for quiet
conversation. The entrance from the frequented street at the
left (A) is so arranged that passers-by could not look in; near
the entrance from the street on the opposite side (A') is a
closet (<i>c</i>). The decoration of the court was extremely simple.
Columns and walls were unpainted; on the lower parts, stucco
with bits of brick in it; above, white plaster.</p>

<p>From the court a corridor (<i>a</i>) led into the men's apodyterium,
which could be entered also on the north side from the Strada
delle Terme. This room contained benches, as shown on the
plan; but there were no niches, as in the dressing rooms of
the Stabian Baths, and wooden shelves or lockers may have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
been used instead. The small dark chamber at the north end
(<i>f</i>) may have been used as a storeroom for unguents, such as
the Greeks called <i>elaeothesium</i>. It seems to have been thought
necessary here to connect the dressing room with the furnace
room (V) by a separate passage.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig092" id="fig092"></a>
<img src="images/fig092.jpg" width="535" height="427" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 92.&mdash;Baths near the Forum: interior of the men's tepidarium.</p>
</div>

<p>Light was admitted to the dressing room through a window
in the lunette at the south end, closed by a pane of glass half
an inch thick, set in a bronze frame that turned on two pivots.
On either side of the window are huge Tritons in stucco relief,
with vases on their shoulders, surrounded by dolphins; underneath
is a mask of Oceanus, and in the same wall is a niche
for a lamp, similar to that seen in <a href="#fig092">Fig. 92</a>, blackened by the soot.</p>

<p>The frigidarium is well preserved. In all its arrangements
it is almost an exact counterpart of the one in the Stabian
Baths, but the scheme of decoration, suggestive of a garden,
is less realistically carried out, the ground being yellow; and
the round window at the apex of the domed ceiling has a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
rectangular extension toward the south in order to admit as
much sunlight as possible.</p>

<p>The tepidarium, as will be seen from our illustration (<a href="#fig092">Fig. 92</a>),
is in the condition of the tepidariums of the Stabian Baths
before the improved arrangements for heating were introduced.
There were no warm air chambers in the walls or the floor.
At one end we see the remains of the large bronze brazier and
benches (the iron grating is modern) presented by Vaccula, to
which reference has already been made <a href="#Page_197">(p. 197</a>). The feet of
the benches are modelled to represent hoofs, each with a cow's
head above.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig093" id="fig093"></a>
<img src="images/fig093.jpg" width="406" height="182" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 93.&mdash;Longitudinal section of the men's caldarium.</p>
</div>

<p>There are niches in the walls, as formerly in the tepidariums
of the Stabian Baths, but several of them for some reason have
been walled up. Wild-visaged, muscular Atlantes stand out
in bold projection on the front of the partitions between the
niches, sustaining a cornice upon their uplifted hands. The
window, seen in the illustration above the lamp niche, was
closed, as that in the dressing room, by a pane of glass in a
bronze frame.</p>

<p>The decoration of the ceiling, unfortunately only in part
preserved, is well designed. Along the lower edge are arabesques,
interwoven in a scroll pattern, in white stucco on a
white background. Above these are panels of different sizes,
in which raised white ornaments and figures appear on a white,
blue, or violet ground; among the motives are Cupid leaning on
his bow, Apollo riding on a griffin, Ganymede with the eagle,
and Cupids on sea horses.</p>

<p>The caldarium is well preserved; only a part of the vaulted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
ceiling has been destroyed. The hollow space for hot air in
the floor and walls is indicated in our section (<a href="#fig093">Fig. 93</a>). Here
we see at the right, the bath basin, lined with white marble,
with its sloping back affording a comfortable support for the
bathers; at the other end is the apsidal niche (<i>schola</i>) with the
labrum. The direction of Vitruvius, that the labrum should be
placed under a window in such a way that the shadows of those
standing around should not fall on it, is here literally observed.
There were three other small windows at the same end of the
room, and a niche for a lamp.</p>

<p>We learn from an inscription on the labrum, in bronze letters,
that it was made under the direction of Gnaeus Melissaeus Aper
and Marcus Staius Rufus, who were duumvirs in 3-4 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>, at
a cost of 5250 sesterces, not far from $270. This room seems
to have received its final form before the new method of heating
the water in the alveus came into vogue; there is no trace
of a bronze heater, such as that found in connection with the
bath basin of the women's caldarium at the Stabian Baths. The
simple decoration is in marked contrast with the usual ornamentation
of the later styles. Above a low marble base are
yellow walls divided by dark red pilasters, shown in <a href="#fig093">Fig. 93</a>.
These support a projecting flat cornice of dark red, whose surface
is richly ornamented with stucco reliefs. The ceiling is
moulded in flutings running up to the crown of the vault; only
in the ceiling of the schola do we find raised figures.</p>

<p>The rooms of the women's baths are small, their arrangement
being determined in part by the irregular shape of the corner
of the building in which they are placed; but the system of
heating is more complete than in the men's baths, for both the
tepidarium (3) and the caldarium (4) were provided with hollow
floors and hot air spaces in the walls extending to the lunettes
and the ceiling. The vaulted ceilings of both of these rooms, as
well as of the apodyterium, are preserved; but the caldarium
has lost its hollow floor and walls, together with the bath basin,
which was placed in a large niche at the right as one entered;
only the base of the labrum remains. The condition of this
room may be due to the earthquake of the year 63, the necessary
repairs not having been made before the eruption. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
was no connection between the women's baths and the court
at the rear (D), which had a separate entrance from the street.
At the women's entrance there was a narrow waiting room for
attendants, separated from the street by a thin wall and protected
by a roof.</p>

<p>The furnace room could be entered at one end from the
street. The three cylindrical tanks for hot, lukewarm, and cold
water were arranged as in the Stabian Baths. Beyond the
tanks is a cistern (<i>g</i>), which was supplied in part by rain water
from the roof, in part by a feed pipe connected with the water
system of the city. The raised walk (<i>h</i>) on the right side of the
furnace room is continued to the small court (D) in the corner
of which is a stairway leading to the flat roof of the men's
caldarium. From this point of vantage, the view over the
landscape and the sea must have been beautiful in antiquity,
as it is to-day.</p>

<p>A sundial doubtless stood on the larger of the two pillars in
the court (<i>d</i>), which is about seventeen feet high and nearly five
feet thick at the base; on the smaller pillar was perhaps a statue
or other ornamental object of the sort frequently seen in wall
paintings.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIX<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE CENTRAL BATHS</i></span></h3>

<p>Seneca in an entertaining letter (Ep. 86) gives an account of
a visit about 60 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> to the villa at Liternum in which the Elder
Scipio had lived in the years immediately preceding his death,
in 183 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> The philosopher was particularly struck with the
bath, the simplicity of which he contrasts forcibly with the luxurious
appointments of his own time. We cannot follow him
through the extended disquisition&mdash;he speaks of various refinements
of luxury of which we find no traces at Pompeii; but he
mentions as the most striking difference the lack of light in the
old bath, with its small apertures more like chinks than windows,
while in his day the baths were provided with large windows
protected by glass, and people 'wanted to be parboiled in
full daylight,' besides having the enjoyment meanwhile of a
beautiful view. Some such feeling as this we have in turning
from the two older baths at Pompeii&mdash;one of pre-Roman origin,
the other dating from the time of Sulla&mdash;to the Central
Baths, which were in process of construction at the time of the
eruption, and had been designed in accordance with the prevailing
mode of life.</p>

<p>This extensive establishment, at the corner of Stabian and
Nola streets, occupied the whole of a block; but a large part of
the frontage on the two streets mentioned was utilized for shops.
Notwithstanding the size of the building, it had only a single
series of apartments, which were laid out on a correspondingly
large scale. It was doubtless built for men, although the use of
it at certain hours by women may possibly have been contemplated,
in case the women's baths at the two other establishments
should be overcrowded.</p>

<p>Entrances from three streets lead to the ample palaestra,
from which the remains of the houses demolished to make room

for it had not yet been entirely removed. On the northeast
side is the excavation for a large swimming tank (<i>h</i>), and for
a water channel leading to the closet (<i>e</i>). In order to have
water at hand for building purposes, the masons had built a low
wall around an old impluvium
on the south
side (shown on the plan,
<a href="#fig094">Fig. 94</a>) into which a
feed pipe ran. For a
short distance on the
north side the stylobate
had been made ready for
the building of the colonnade;
elsewhere only
the preliminary work
had been done. The
rooms at the southeast
corner (<i>f</i>, <i>g</i>) were no
doubt intended for dressing
rooms for the palaestra
and the plunge bath.</p>

<p>Two small rooms (<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>) open upon the north entrance of the
palaestra; one of them, perhaps, was to be a ticket office, for
the adjustment of matters relating to admission, the other a
cloak room, in which the <i>capsarius</i> would guard the valuables of
the bathers.</p>

<p>Two doors admit the visitor from the palaestra to the series
of bath rooms, one of them opening from the north end of the
colonnade. The first room (<i>i</i>, <i>l</i>) was designed to answer the
purpose of a store, with four booths (<i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>) opening into
it for the sale of edibles and bathers' conveniences.</p>

<p>The apodyterium (<i>p</i>), tepidarium (<i>q</i>), and caldarium (<i>s</i>) had
each three large windows opening on the palaestra; two of those
belonging to the tepidarium are seen in <a href="#fig095">Fig. 95</a>. None of the
rooms were finished, though a hollow floor and hollow walls had
been built in the tepidarium, caldarium, and Laconicum. The
bath basins yet lacked their marble linings, and the two furnaces
(at <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>) had not been built.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span></p>

<p>Five smaller windows on the southeast side of the caldarium
looked out on a narrow garden, about which the workmen had
commenced to build a wall to cut off the sight of the firemen
passing to and fro between the two furnaces. The caldarium
was so placed as to receive the greatest possible amount of
sunlight, particularly in the afternoon hours, when it would be
used; this was in accordance with a recommendation of Vitruvius,
who says that the windows of baths ought, whenever possible,
to face the southwest, otherwise the south.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 95.&mdash;View of the Central Baths, looking from the palaestra into the tepidarium.</p>
</div>

<p>The contrast is indeed marked between the numerous large
windows here, with their attractive outlook, and the small
apertures, high in the walls and ceiling, through which light
was admitted in the older baths.</p>

<p>In the Central Baths there was no frigidarium; but a large
basin for cold baths, nearly five feet deep, was placed in the
dressing room opposite the windows. Supply pipes were so
laid that jets would spring into the basin from three small
niches, one in each wall; the overflow was conducted by
pipes under the floor to a catch basin (<i>w</i>), and thence to the
street.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span></p>

<p>The tepidarium (<i>q</i>)&mdash;here, as usual, relatively small&mdash;is connected
with the apodyterium by two doors, and similarly with
the caldarium. The latter room has a bath basin at each end,
thus affording accommodations for twenty-six or twenty-eight
bathers at once; at the middle of the southeast side was a
smaller basin that took the place of the labrum. The hot air
flues leading from the furnaces under the bath basins were
already built, and above them openings were left for semi-cylindrical
heaters like that in the women's caldarium of the
Stabian Baths.</p>

<p>The round sweating room, Laconicum, was made more ample
by means of four semicircular niches, and lighted by three
small round windows just above the cornice of the domed ceiling.
There was probably another round opening at the apex,
designed for a bronze shutter, which could be opened or closed
from below by means of a chain, so as to regulate the temperature.
Doors led into the Laconicum from both the tepidarium
and the caldarium.</p>

<p>The oblong court between the bath rooms and the street on
the northeast side was apparently to be laid out as a garden.
At the north end the workmen had begun to build pillars for a
short colonnade. A large square foundation for a sundial
stands near the opposite corner.

<h3>CHAPTER XXX<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE AMPHITHEATRE</i></span></h3>

<p>In the southeast corner of the city, at a distance from the
other excavations, lies the Amphitheatre, the scene of gladiatorial
combats. The Pompeians called it 'the show,' <i>spectacula</i>,
as in the inscription, preserved in two copies, that gives us
the names of the builders: <i>C. Quinctius C. f. Valgus, M.
Porcius M. f[ilius] duo vir[i] quinq[uennales] coloniai honoris
caussa spectacula de sua peq[unia] fac[iunda] coer[arunt] et
coloneis locum in perpetuom deder[unt</i>]. According to this, the
Amphitheatre was built by the same men, Valgus and Porcius,
who are already known to us as the builders of the Small
Theatre <a href="#Page_153">(p. 153</a>); and they presented it to the city in recognition
of the honor conferred upon them by their reëlection as
duumvirs. The Amphitheatre may thus have been finished
half a decade later than the Theatre, but in any case it belongs
to the earliest years of the Roman colony,&mdash;as might be inferred,
in default of other evidence, from the archaic spelling
of the inscription, and the character of the masonry, which is
like that of the Small Theatre and the baths north of the Forum
(<a href="#Page_41">p. 41</a>).</p>

<p>The colonists, however, did not receive from Rome their impulse
to erect such a building. The passion for gladiatorial
combats was developed in Campania earlier, and manifested
itself more strongly, than in Latium. Strabo's statement that
gladiators were brought forward at Campanian banquets, in
larger or smaller numbers according to the rank of the guests,
has reference to the period before the Second Punic War; but
it was considered a noteworthy event in Rome when, in 264 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>,
gladiators engaged in combat in the Forum Boarium in celebration
of funeral rites, as also when, on a similar occasion in
216 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, twenty-two pairs fought in the Forum. Buildings were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
erected for gladiatorial shows in Campanian towns earlier than
at the Capital. As late as the year 46 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> the spectators who
witnessed the games given by Julius Caesar sat on wooden seats
supported by temporary staging; and the first stone amphitheatre
in Rome was built by Statilius Taurus in 29 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, almost
half a century after the quinquennial duumvirate of Valgus and
Porcius. The Amphitheatre at Pompeii is the oldest known
to us from either literary or monumental sources.</p>

<p>In comparison with later and more imposing structures, our
Amphitheatre seems indeed unpretentious. Its exterior elevation
is relatively low (<a href="#fig096">Fig. 96</a>); as our section shows (<a href="#fig099">Fig. 99</a>),
the arena and the lower ranges of seats are in a great hollow
excavated for the purpose below the level of the ground.
The dimensions (length 460 feet, breadth 345) are small when
compared with those of the Coliseum (615 and 510 feet, respectively)
or even the amphitheatres at Capua or Pozzuoli; and
the lack of artistic form is noteworthy.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig096" id="fig096"></a>
<img src="images/fig096.jpg" width="537" height="202" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 96.&mdash;The Amphitheatre, seen from the west side.</p>
</div>

<p>The exhibitions held here must also have been on a modest
scale. There were no underground chambers, below the arena,
with devices by means of which wild beasts could be lifted up
into view and the sand suddenly covered with new combatants.
The limited means of this small city were not adequate to make
provision for the elaborate equipment and costly decoration
found in the amphitheatres of larger towns.</p>

<p>The arena, a view of which is given in <a href="#plate06">Plate VI</a>, is surrounded
by a wall about 6½ feet high. This wall was covered
with frescoes which, still fresh at the time of excavation, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
now known to us only from copies in the Naples Museum.
They consisted of alternate broad and narrow panels, the latter
containing each a herm between two columns, while the larger
spaces presented alternately a conventional pattern and a
scene connected with the games. One of the scenes gives an
interesting glimpse of the preparations for the combat (<a href="#fig097">Fig. 97</a>).
In the middle we see the overseer marking out with a long staff
the ring within which the combatants must fight. At the right
a gladiator stands, partly armed; two attendants are bringing
him a helmet and a sword. A hornblower, also partly armed,
stands at the left; and behind him two companions, squatting
on the ground, make ready his helmet and shield. At either
end of the scene, in the background, is an image of a Winged
Victory with a wreath and palm.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig097" id="fig097"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 97.&mdash;Preparations for the combat. Wall painting, from the Amphitheatre.</p>
</div>

<p>The limestone coping of the wall about the arena shows
traces of iron in the joints between the blocks, apparently
remains of a grating designed to protect the spectators from
attacks by the infuriated wild beasts. The traces are not visible
all the way around, but this may be accounted for on the supposition
that repairs were in progress at the time of the eruption.</p>

<p>Two broad corridors (3, 3<span class="s08">A</span>) connect the ends of the arena
with the outside of the building. The one at the north end,
toward Vesuvius, follows a straight line; the other bends
sharply to the right in order to avoid the city wall, which bounds
the structure on the south and east sides. By these corridors
the gladiators entered the arena, first in festal array, passing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
in stately procession across the sand from one entrance to
the other, then coming forth in pairs as they were summoned
to mortal combat.</p>

<p>At the middle of the west side there is a third passage,
narrow and low (<i>e</i>); this is the grewsome corridor through
which the bodies of the dead were dragged by means of hooks,
its entrance being the Porta Libitinensis, 'Death Gate.' Near
the inner end of each of the three corridors is a small, dark
chamber (<i>f</i>) the purpose of which is unknown. It has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
suggested that wild animals may have been confined here, but
larger and more easily accessible rooms would have been required
for this purpose. They may have been storerooms for
appliances of various kinds required for the exhibitions.</p>

<p>The seats, of which there are thirty-five rows, have the same
form as those in the Small Theatre, and are of the same material,
gray tufa. They are arranged in three divisions,&mdash;the
lowest, <i>ima cavea</i>, having five rows; the middle division, <i>media
cavea</i>, twelve; and the highest, <i>summa cavea</i>, eighteen (<a href="#fig098">Figs. 98</a>,
<a href="#fig099">99</a>). In the middle section of the ima cavea on each side the
place of the seats is taken by four low, broad ledges, set aside
for members of the city council, who could place upon them
the seats of honor, <i>bisellia</i>, to the use of which they were
entitled. At the middle of the east side the second ledge is
interrupted for a distance of ten feet (the break is shown in
<a href="#plate06">Plate VI</a>), a double width being thus given to the lowest. This
place was designed for seats of special honor, and was, no doubt,
reserved for the official who provided the games, and his associates.
On the same side the ledges are extended into the next
section on the south, the continuity of the seats being interrupted
by a low barrier. This supplementary section was, perhaps,
intended for certain freedmen, as the Augustales (<a href="#Page_100">p. 100</a>),
who had the right to use bisellia, but who nevertheless could
not become members of the city council, and were not ranked
on a social equality with the occupants of the middle section.</p>

<p>The seats of the ima cavea and media cavea were reached
through a vaulted passage (4), which, in accordance with ancient
usage, we may call a crypt. It ran under the first seats of the
second range, and stairs led from it to both divisions. It might
be entered either from the two broad corridors leading to the
arena, or directly from the west side by means of two separate
passages (<i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, on the plan). It is, however, interrupted at the
middle on each side of the Amphitheatre. On the west side
the prolongation of the crypt would have interfered with the
use of the corridor leading to the Death Gate; but as no such
reason existed for blocking the east branch, it is probable that
the designers of the Amphitheatre interrupted both branches
of the crypt in order to force the spectators who had seats in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
the lower and middle divisions of the south half of the structure
to enter and leave by the somewhat inconvenient south
entrances, which are situated in an angle of the city wall. Had
the crypt been carried completely around, the crowd would
always have pressed into the building through the north entrances,
which opened toward the city, thus causing confusion,
if not danger, on occasions of special interest.</p>

<div class="figcenter p6"><a name="plate06" id="plate06"></a>
<img src="images/plate06.jpg" width="600" height="439" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PLATE VI.&mdash;INTERIOR OF THE AMPHITHEATRE, LOOKING NORTHWEST</p>
</div>

<p>In the corridor leading from the north entrance, as may be
seen on the plan, a row of stones with square holes in them
were placed in the pavement near the left wall. In these stakes
could be set and connected by ropes, thus making a narrow passageway
along the side. The purpose of the arrangement is
not difficult to understand. Through the north corridor the
gladiators entered and left the building, and the wild beasts
were brought in; so provision had to be made to give them a
passage separate from that used by the spectators. Before the
commencement of an exhibition the whole entrance was accessible
to the populace, which eagerly crowded forward to secure
seats in good season. When they had for the most part found
their places, the barrier was set up, and only a narrow alley
was left along the east wall for belated spectators who wished
to pass into the crypt on that side; the rest of the passage was
reserved for the gladiators, and the spectators whose seats were
reached from the opposite branches of the crypt were obliged to
use the side entrance (<i>c</i>).</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig099" id="fig099"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 99.&mdash;Transverse section of the Amphitheatre.<br />
<a href="images/fig099fs.jpg">View larger image</a></p>
</div>

<p>The middle division was separated from the summa cavea (8)
by a low parapet with a narrow passage (<i>praecinctio</i>, <i>b</i>) on the
upper side. The seats of the summa cavea could be reached in
two ways, by passing through the crypt and up the long flights
of stairs that led through the middle division to the top (best
seen in <a href="#fig099">Fig. 99</a>), or by mounting the stairs on the outside of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
building to the terrace (10), which has the same level as the
highest rows of seats; it is also of the same height as the city
wall, with which it is merged on the south and east sides. The
terrace was no doubt the principal means of access; ample provision
was made for the crowd by building two large double
stairways (11), with smaller single flights at the corners where
the terrace joined the city wall (12).</p>

<p>Between the terrace and the seats of the summa cavea was
an elevated gallery, divided up into small boxes, about four feet
square; under the row of boxes were vaulted
vomitoria, making the seats of the summa cavea
accessible from the terrace. A passage ran
along the outside of the boxes, with steps leading
from the terrace; only every third box was
connected with this passage, however, the other two of the group
being entered from a narrow ramp along the front (<a href="#fig100">Fig. 100</a>).</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p>The Amphitheatre had a seating capacity of about twenty
thousand persons. We have no information in regard to the
distribution of seats, but it may safely be assumed, from the
arrangements known to have existed elsewhere, that the lowest
division was reserved for the city officials with their friends
and other prominent people; that an admission fee was charged
for the seats of the middle division; and that the seats of the
upper division were free. The gallery was doubtless set aside
for women, who were permitted by a regulation promulgated in
the reign of Augustus to have a place only in the upper portion
of the Amphitheatre.</p>

<p>Besides the inscription giving the names of the builders
(<a href="#Page_212">p. 212</a>) there are several others of interest in connection with
the building. Four of them, cut in large letters in the travertine
coping of the wall about the arena, commemorate the construction
of seats. One reads: <i>L. Saginius II vir i. d. pr[o] lu[dis]
lu[minibus] ex d[ecurionum] d[ecreto] cun[eum]</i>,&mdash;'Lucius
Saginius, duumvir with judiciary authority, in accordance with a
resolution of the city council (constructed) a section of seats in the
place of the games and illumination,' that otherwise he would
have been required to provide. Another of the series is even
more abbreviated, but the meaning is clear: <span class="smcap">MAG · PAG · AUG · F ·</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
<span class="smcap">S · PRO · LUD · EX · D · D</span>, that is, <i>Magistri Pagi Augusti Felicis
Suburbani pro ludis ex decurionum decreto</i>,&mdash;'The officials of the
suburb Pagus Augustus Felix by authority of a resolution of
the city council (constructed a section of seats) in the place
of providing games.'</p>

<p>From an inscription in the Stabian Baths, to which reference
has already been made (<a href="#Page_195">p. 195</a>), it is clear that some freedom of
choice was permitted to the city officials regarding the disposition
of the sum which they were required to contribute for public
purposes in recognition of the honor conferred upon them
by their election. The Amphitheatre was not provided with
seats at the beginning, and one wedge-shaped section (<i>cuneus</i>)
after another was added until the divisions were complete;
meanwhile the spectators made themselves as comfortable as
they could on the sloping ground. As the organization of the
Pagus Augustus Felix did not take place till 7 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, the construction
of the seats could not at that time have been completed;
but they were all finished before the overwhelming of
the city.</p>

<p>The north entrance to the arena was adorned with two portrait
statues of Gaius Cuspius Pansa, father and son, placed in
niches in the walls facing each other. The statues have disappeared,
but the inscriptions underneath are still in place.
What services the Pansas had rendered in connection with the
Amphitheatre to merit this distinction, we do not know; but
the father, as the inscription indicates, was 'prefect in accordance
with the law of Petronius' (<a href="#Page_14">p. 14</a>); that is, he was appointed
by the city council to exercise the functions of the two
duumvirs when no valid election occurred. Bulwer Lytton, by
a natural error, makes Pansa a commissioner to secure the execution
of an altogether different <i>Lex Petronia</i>, which forbade
the giving of slaves to wild beasts unless judicial sentence had
been previously passed upon them.</p>

<p>The attraction of the gladiatorial exhibitions, together with
the ample seating capacity of the building, stimulated attendance
from neighboring cities, and on one occasion unfortunate
results followed. In the year 59 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> a Roman senator, Livineius
Regulus, who had been expelled from the Senate, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
had apparently taken up his residence at Pompeii, gave an
exhibition that attracted a great concourse. Among those who
came to witness the combats were many inhabitants of Nuceria.
The people of the two towns may not have been on the best of
terms previously; whatever the cause, the Pompeians and Nucerians
commenced with mutual bantering and recriminations, then
resorted to stone-throwing, and finally engaged in a free fight
with weapons.</p>

<p>The Nucerians, as can easily be understood, fared the worse,
having many killed and wounded. They carried the matter to
Rome, lodging a complaint with Nero; the emperor referred
the case to the Senate, which decreed that Regulus and the
leaders of the disturbance should be sent into exile, that the
Pompeians should not be permitted to hold any gladiatorial
exhibitions for the space of ten years, and that the illegal societies
at Pompeii&mdash;in regard to which, unfortunately, we have no
further information&mdash;should be dissolved. From the receipts of
Caecilius Jucundus we learn, further, that the duumvirs of the
year 59 were removed from office, and that with the new duumvirs,
elected in their places, a magistrate with extraordinary
powers, <i>praefectus iuri dicundo</i>, was associated&mdash;measures that
indicate how serious the disturbance of public order must have
been.</p>

<p>Reminiscences of this bloody fray are found in several inscriptions
scratched on walls; and a lively idea of it is given by
a wall painting found in 1869 in a house near the theatres, now
in the Naples Museum (<a href="#fig101">Fig. 101</a>). The picture is of special interest
as throwing light on the surroundings of the Amphitheatre
and some of its arrangements. The open space with the
trees in the foreground, among which are various booths, remind
one of a park; at the right is a single house. It is clear from
the painting that the women's boxes, in the gallery, were arched
in front; and we see how the great awning, <i>velum</i>, was stretched
over the south end to protect the audience from the sun. It
was carried by the two towers of the city wall (one of them is
indicated on the plan, 13) and by masts that stood in the passage
behind the women's boxes, where several of the perforated
stones in which they were set may still be seen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>

<p>That the sports of the Amphitheatre had at all times the
keenest interest for the Pompeians is evident, not only from
the number of notices having to do with the games, which we
see painted in red on walls along the streets or on tombs by
the roadside, but also from the countless graffiti in both houses
and public places having reference to combats and favorite
gladiators. The limits of space do not permit us to describe
the gladiatorial exhibitions as they took place at Pompeii and
other Roman cities; but the inscriptions bring so near to us the
scenes and excitement of those days that it seems worth while
to quote and interpret a few typical examples.</p>

V. Nonas Maias, et venatio erit</i>,&mdash;'Twenty pairs of gladiators,
furnished by Quintus Monnius Rufus, will fight at Nola May 1,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
2, and 3, and there will be a hunt.' The forms of the letters
and the numerous ligatures point to a comparatively early
period, perhaps antedating the reign of Augustus. The 'hunt,'
<i>venatio</i>, was an exhibition of wild beasts, which sometimes
were pitted against one another, sometimes fought with men.
Another tomb close by bears a notice of a gladiatorial combat
to take place at Nuceria.</p>

<p>A still larger number of gladiators is announced in this notice:
<i>Cn. Allei Nigidi Mai quinq[uennalis] gl[adiatorum] par[ia]
XXX et eor[um] supp[ositicii] pugn[abunt] Pompeis VIII
VII VI K[alendas] Dec[embres]. Ven[atio] erit. Maio quin[quennali]
feliciter. Paris va[le]</i>,&mdash;'Thirty pairs of gladiators
furnished by Cn. Alleius Nigidius Maius, quinquennial duumvir,
together with their substitutes, will fight at Pompeii November
24, 25, 26. There will be a hunt. Hurrah for Maius the quinquennial!
Bravo, Paris!' The substitutes were to take the
place of the killed or wounded, that the sport might not suffer
interruption. Nigidius Maius appears to have been a rich
Pompeian of the time of Claudius. In another painted inscription,
he advertises a considerable property for rent (<a href="#Page_489">p.
489</a>). His daughter, as we know from an inscription belonging
to a statue erected in her honor, was a priestess of Venus and
Ceres. Paris was probably a popular gladiator.</p>

<p>Other officials besides duumvirs provided exhibitions. Thus
an aedile: <i>A. Suetti Certi aedilis familia gladiatoria pugnab[it]
Pompeis pr[idie] K[alendas] Iunias; venatio et vela erunt</i>,&mdash;'The
gladiatorial troop of the aedile Aulus Suettius Certus will
fight at Pompeii May 31; there will be a hunt, and awnings
will be provided.'</p>

<p>The following notice can be dated, approximately: <i>D. Lucreti
Satri Valentis flaminis Neronis Caesaris Aug[usti] fili perpetui
gladiatorum paria XX, et D. Lucreti Valentis fili glad[iatorum]
paria X pug[nabunt] Pompeis VI V IV III pr[idie] Idus
Apr[iles]. Venatio legitima et vela erunt. Scr[ipsit] Aemilius
Celer sing[ulus] ad luna[m]</i>,&mdash;'Twenty pairs of gladiators
furnished by Decimus Lucretius Satrius Valens, permanent
priest of Nero, son of the emperor, and ten pairs of gladiators
furnished by Decimus Lucretius Valens his son, will fight at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
Pompeii April 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. There will be a big hunt,
and awnings. Aemilius Celer wrote this, all alone by the light
of the moon.' The reference to Nero as the son of the emperor,
shows that the inscription was written after he was
adopted by Claudius, in 50 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>, and before Claudius's death,
in 54. Celer was an enterprising painter of notices, whose
name appears elsewhere in a similar connection.</p>

<p>Besides the general announcement of a gladiatorial exhibition,
a detailed programme, <i>libellus</i>, was prepared in advance,
of which copies were sold. No such copy has come down to
us, but the character of the contents of a programme may be
inferred from the order of events which a Pompeian with waste
time on his hands scratched on a wall; the memorandum covers
two exhibitions, which came near together in the early part of
May, the result of each combat being carefully noted. Unfortunately
the letters have now become almost illegible; but we
give the superscription and three of the nine pairs of combatants
mentioned in the second programme, which is the
better preserved of the two, adding in a separate column the
full forms of the abbreviated words; the figures indicate
the number of combats in which the different gladiators had
taken part:&mdash;</p>

<p>The name of the official who gave the exhibition (<i>munus</i>) is
obliterated. The contests extended over four days, May 12-15.</p>

<p>In the first pair of gladiators Pugnax, equipped with Thracian
weapons&mdash;a small, round shield and short, curved sword or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
dagger&mdash;was matched with the Myrmillo Murranus, who bore
arms of the Gallic fashion, with the image of a fish on his helmet.
Both were <i>Neroniani</i>; that is, from the training school
for gladiators founded by Nero, apparently at Capua. Pugnax
and Murranus had both been through three contests previously.
The name of a gladiator entering a combat for the first time
was not followed by a number, but by the letter T, standing for
<i>tiro</i>, 'novice.' At the left we see the record added to the programme
by the writer in order to give the result of the combat.
Pugnax was the victor, Murranus was killed.</p>

<p>In the second pair Cycnus, in heavy armor, was pitted against
Atticus, who had the Thracian arms. Both were from the
training school founded by Julius Caesar, probably at Capua,
and hence are called <i>Iuliani</i>. Cycnus won, but the audience
had compassion on Atticus, and his life was spared. The same
term was applied to a defeated gladiator permitted to leave the
arena as to a soldier having an honorable discharge&mdash;<i>missus</i>,
'let go.'</p>

<p>The third pair fought in chariots, being dressed in British
costume. Scylax was from the Julian school. Such establishments
let out gladiators to those who gave exhibitions, and
obtained in this way a considerable income. But Publius Ostorius,
as his name implies, was a freeman; presumably he was a
gladiator, who, having served a full term, had secured his freedom,
and was now fighting on his own account. Though beaten,
he was permitted to live, perhaps on account of his creditable
record; he had engaged in fifty-one combats.</p>

<p>The combatants from the schools of Caesar and Nero were
especially popular, and were generally victorious; but gladiators
belonging to other proprietors are mentioned, as in the inscriptions
of a house on Nola Street, which will be mentioned again
presently. Here we find gladiators who were evidently freemen
named with others who were slaves of different masters. In
only one of these inscriptions, however, do we find the name of
an owner that is known to us: <i>Essed[arius] Auriolus Sisen[nae]</i>.
The chariot fighter Auriolus belonged to a Sisenna, seemingly
either the Sisenna Statilius Taurus, who was consul in 16 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>,
or his son of the same name. As we have seen, it was a Statilius
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
Taurus who built the first permanent amphitheatre in Rome,
in 29 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> The control of this building remained in the hands
of the family. In the columbarium in which the ashes of
their slaves and freedmen were placed, we find inscriptions of a
'guard of the amphitheatre,' and of a 'doorkeeper'&mdash;<i>custos de
amphitheatro</i>, <i>ostiarius ab amphitheatro</i>. It is highly probable
that the family&mdash;the first in Rome after the imperial house&mdash;possessed
a training school, and derived an income from furnishing
gladiators to those who gave exhibitions.</p>

<p>In view of these facts, we must suppose that the 'troop'
(<i>familia gladiatoria</i>) of Suettius Certus, for example, was simply
a band of gladiators brought together for a particular
engagement, not a permanent organization. The giver of an
exhibition would make a contract for the gladiators that he
might need. At the close of the combats the dead would be
counted, the surviving freemen paid off and dismissed, and the
surviving slaves returned to their masters, 'the troop' thus
going out of existence.</p>

<p>Occasionally the individual who provided the combats would
erect a monument to the fallen, by way of perpetuating the
memory of his munificence. A familiar example is the memorial
set up by Gaius Salvius Capito at Venosa, of which the
inscription is extant. The names are given of the gladiators
who were killed, together with the number of their previous
combats and victories. They were slaves of different masters,
only one of them, Optatus, being owned by Capito himself.
Optatus was a tiro, who fell thus in his first contest. Possibly
his master had obliged him, on account of some misdemeanor,
to enter the arena with little previous training.</p>

<p>Besides the classes of inscriptions of which examples have
been presented, all sorts of scratches upon the plastered walls
bear witness to the general enthusiasm for gladiatorial sports.
Sometimes there is simply the name of a gladiator, with his
school and the number of combats, as <i>Auctus, Iul[ianus],
XXXXX</i>; sometimes we find a rough outline of a figure with a
boastful legend, as <i>Hermaïscus invictus hac</i>, 'Here's the unconquered
Hermaïscus.'</p>

<p>There are also memoranda in regard to particular combats,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
illustrated by rude sketches. Thus on a wall in the house of
the Centenary we find a drawing of a gladiator in flight, pursued
by another, with the note: <i>Officiosus fugit VIII Idus
Nov[embres] Druso Caesare M. Iunio Silano cos.</i>,&mdash;'Officiosus
fled on November 6, in the year 15 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>' A similar sketch has
been found in another house, with these words written beside
the fleeing gladiator, <i>Q. P[e]tronius O[c]ta[v]us XXXIII,
m[issus]</i>; beside the pursuer, <i>Severus lib[ertus], XXXXXV,
v[icit]</i>. Severus was thus a gladiator who had been a slave,
and had gained his freedom: he had fought fifty-five combats.
Petronius Octavus may have been a freeman, who had fought
on his own account from the beginning. In taverns a painting
of a gladiator with an inscription like the record of a programme
was a favorite subject of decoration.</p>

<p>Athletes in all ages have won the admiration of the gentler
sex; and it would be surprising if among so many gladiatorial
graffiti there were not some containing references to female
admirers. In the peristyle of a house on Nola Street (V. v. 3)
the names of about thirty gladiators are found; the kinds of
weapons and the owners are designated, and the number of
previous combats given, as in the programmes, while records
of the results of the combats are entirely lacking. Terms of
endearment are lavished upon two, Celadus, Threx, and Crescens,
net fighter; Celadus is <i>suspirium puellarum</i>, 'maidens'
sigh,' and <i>puellarum decus</i>, 'glory of girls'; while Crescens is
<i>puparum dominus</i>, 'lord o' lassies,' and <i>puparum medicus</i>, 'the
darlings' doctor.'</p>

<p>Another graffito informs us that at one time&mdash;before the year
63&mdash;a gladiator lived in this house: <i>Samus / Ↄ / m[urmillo],
idem eq[ues], hic hab[itat]</i>,&mdash;'Samus, who has fought once,
and once conquered (<i>Ↄ</i> is for <i>corona</i>, 'crown'), Myrmillo, and
at the same time fighter on horseback, lives here.' Other
gladiators, no doubt, shared the dwelling with him; and the
amatory graffiti may have been written by one and another
<i>miles gloriosus</i>, referring to conquests outside the arena, or by
companions in bitter scorn.

<h3>CHAPTER XXXI<br />

<span class="s08"><i>STREETS, WATER SYSTEM, AND WAYSIDE SHRINES</i></span></h3>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig102" id="fig102"></a>
<img src="images/fig102.jpg" width="539" height="413" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 102.&mdash;View of Abbondanza Street, looking east.<br />

At the left, fountain of Concordia Augusta, and side entrance of the Eumachia building.<br />

In the pavement, three stepping stones.</p>
</div>

<p>The streets of Pompeii vary greatly in width. The widest
is Mercury Street, the continuation of which near the Forum
has a breadth of nearly 32 feet. Next come Abbondanza
and Nola streets, the greatest width of which is about 28
feet; the other streets and thoroughfares vary from 10 to 20
feet. With unimportant exceptions, broad and narrow streets
alike are paved with polygonal blocks of basalt, which in laying
were fitted to one another with great care; on both sides are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
raised sidewalks, with basalt or tufa curbing. The sidewalks
in some places are paved with small stones, elsewhere are laid
with concrete, or left with a surface of beaten earth. As there
is no uniformity, the sidewalk varying in front of adjoining
houses, it is clear that the choice of materials was left to individual
owners of abutting property. The limits of ownership
are often designated by boundary stones, laid in the surface of
the walk.</p>

<p>Broad ruts, worn by wheels, are seen in the pavement, shallower
in places where the basalt flags, cut from the lowest
stratum of the stream of lava, are particularly hard; deeper
wherever there are blocks quarried nearer the surface. Only
the principal streets were wide enough to allow wagons to meet
and pass; elsewhere drivers must have waited at a corner for a
coming team to go by. It seems likely that driving on the
streets of the city was forbidden, wheeled vehicles being used
only for traffic; people who wished to ride availed themselves
of litters.</p>

<p>At various places along the thoroughfares, but particularly at
the corners, large oblong stepping stones with rounded corners
were set in the pavement at convenient distances for those wishing
to cross, the surface being on a level with the sidewalk. The
number varied according to the width of the pavement; in the
broadest streets as many as five were used. They were arranged
always in such a way as to leave places for the wagon
wheels. It is not difficult to understand how Pompeian drivers
guided their teams past them; draft animals were attached to
the wagon by means of a yoke fastened to the end of the pole,
and, as there were no tugs or whippletrees, they had a greater
freedom of movement than is allowed to modern teams.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that so complete a system of paving
existed from the beginning of the city. Some light is thrown
on the period of its laying by two inscriptions,&mdash;one, <span class="smcap">EX · K ·
QUI</span>, cut in the edge of the sidewalk west of Insula IX. iv.; the
other, <span class="smcap">K · Q</span>, in the pavement between the second and fourth
Insulae of Region VII. Both are evidently dates, and in full
would read <i>ex Kalendis Quinctilibus</i>, 'from the first day of
July,' and <i>Kalendis Quinctilibus</i>, 'July 1.' Apparently they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
relate to the laying of the pavement; this was in place, even in
the unimportant side street of Region VII, when the inscriptions
were cut, and so must go back to the time before the
name of the month <i>Quinctilis</i> was changed to <i>Iulius</i>, our July.
Pompeii was paved, therefore, before 44 <span class="s08">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The stepping stones were particularly useful when there was
a heavy rain; for the water then flowed in torrents down the
streets, as it does to-day in Catania, where the inhabitants have
light bridges which they throw over the crossings after a
storm. There were covered conduits to carry off the surface
drainage of the Forum, one of which runs under the Strada
delle Scuole to the south, the other under the Via Marina to
the west. Elsewhere the water rushed down the streets till it
came near the city walls, where it was collected and carried
off by large storm sewers. These are still in successful operation,
as are also the conduits at the Forum. One is at the west
end of the Vico dei Soprastanti, another at the west end of
Nola Street; and a third leads from Abbondanza Street, where
it is crossed by Stabian Street, toward the south.</p>

<p>There were other sewers in the city, but they were of small
dimensions and have not been fully investigated. They seem
generally to have been under sidewalks. They were not designed
to receive surface water, but the drainage of houses. They cannot
have served this purpose fully, however, for most of the
closets were connected, not with the sewers, but with cesspools.</p>

<p>After the lapse of more than eighteen centuries, the visitor
at Pompeii will distinguish at a glance the business streets from
those less frequented. The sides of the former are lined with
shops; along the latter are blank walls, broken only by house
doors, with now and then a small window high above the pavement.
The greatest volume of business was transacted on the
two main thoroughfares, Stabian and Nola streets; next in
importance were Abbondanza Street, leading from the Forum
toward the Sarno Gate, and the continuation of Augustales
Street from the north end of the Forum toward the east. First
in the list of quiet thoroughfares is the broad Mercury Street,
along which were many homes of wealth; the north end of it is
closed by the city wall.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span></p>

<p>There were many fountains along the streets of Pompeii,
most of them at the corners. They were fed by pipes connecting
with the water system of the city. The construction is
simple. A deep basin was made by placing on their edges four
large slabs of basalt, held together at the corners by iron clamps.
Above one of the longer sides, usually near the middle, is a
short, thick standard, of the same stone, pierced for the lead
feed pipe, which threw a jet of water forward into the basin
below; on the opposite side is a depression through which the
superfluous water ran off into the street. Most of these standards
are ornamented with reliefs, roughly carved but effective,&mdash;an
eagle with a hare in its beak, a calf's head, a bust of
Mercury, a head of Medusa, a drunken Silenus (<a href="#fig103">Fig. 103</a>), or
some other suitable design, arranged so that the water would
spurt from the mouth of the figure or from an amphora.</p>

<p>Occasionally we find a fountain of finer material. That of
Concordia Augusta, of limestone, has already been mentioned
(<a href="#Page_117">p. 117</a>). In the neighborhood of the Porta Marina there is a
fountain of white marble with a relief showing a cock that has
tipped over a jar, from the mouth of which the water flowed.
Both these more costly fountains were probably the gift of
private individuals, one presented to the city by Eumachia, the
other by the owner of the nearest house, at VII. xv. 1-2. All
the fountains bear witness to long use by the depressions worn
in the stone by the hands of those leaning forward to drink.</p>

<p>Water towers stand at the sides of the streets, small pillars
of masonry preserved ordinarily to the height of 20 feet.
Usually on one side there is a deep perpendicular groove
(shown in <a href="#fig103">Fig. 103</a>) in which ran the pipe that carried the water
to the top of the tower, where it was received by a small open
reservoir, presumably of metal, and distributed through numerous
small pipes leading to the fountains and to private houses.
The sides of the towers are often covered with incrustations of
lime deposited from the water, in which the impressions of the
lead pipes are still to be seen; in the case of one tower, at the
northeast corner of Insula VI. xiii, a number of the pipes have
been preserved. A reservoir was placed also on the top of the
commemorative arch at the lower end of Mercury Street, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
which stood the bronze statue of Nero or Caligula (<a href="#Page_48">p. 48</a>); the
traces of the pipes leading from it are clearly seen on the surface
of the arch. Similar water towers are in use now in Constantinople
and Palermo, having been introduced into the latter
city, it would seem, by the Saracens, who very likely took their
water system from that of the Turkish capital.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig103" id="fig103"></a>
<img src="images/fig103.jpg" width="410" height="292" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 103.&mdash;Fountain, water tower, and street shrine, corner of Stabian and
Nola streets.</p>
</div>

<p>In consequence of these arrangements, Pompeii was well
supplied with water. There were flowing jets in all houses
except the poorest, and in some the amount used must have
been large. In the house of the Vettii there were no less than
sixteen jets, in the house of the Silver Wedding, seven; and an
equally generous distribution is found in many other of the
more extensive private establishments. Large quantities of
water were used also in the public baths. The water pipes
were made of sheet lead folded together, a transverse section
showing the shape of a pear. They were of all sizes, according
to the pressure; the flow of water was regulated by means of
stopcocks, much like those in use to-day.</p>

<p>Across the street from the Baths near the Forum, on the
west, is a deep reservoir, of which we give the plan (<a href="#fig104">Fig. 104</a>).
It is built partly below the level of the sidewalk, and measures
about 50 feet in length and 13 in width, being covered by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
vault. In the south end is a window (<i>c</i>), reached from one of
the stairways; when the reservoir was filled to the bottom of the
window, it contained not far from ninety-five thousand gallons.
There were two outlets. One was at the level of the floor,
closed by means of a bronze slide; the grooves in which the
slide worked are preserved. This must have been used only when
the reservoir was cleaned. The other outlet was placed about
three feet above the floor, so that the water could be drawn
off without disturbing the bottom. On the flat roof were rooms
the arrangement of which cannot be determined.</p>

<p>Similar reservoirs are found in Constantinople, designed to
furnish a supply of water in case of siege. Such may have
been the purpose of our structure, which seems to have been
built in the early years of
the Roman colony. The residents,
remembering the hardships
of the siege of Sulla,
may have thought it necessary
to make provision against
a similar strait in the future.</p>

</div>

<p>The source from which the
city received its water supply
has not been discovered. Evidently it did not draw upon the
sources of the Sarno; the water channel constructed by Fontana
(<a href="#Page_25">p. 25</a>) runs through the city at a height of less than sixty
feet above the level of the sea, while the ancient aqueduct that
supplied Pompeii had so great a head that in the highest parts
of the city, more than 130 feet above the sea, it forced the
water to the top of the water towers, at least twenty feet more.
Copious springs can never have existed on the sides of Vesuvius;
water must have been brought to the city from the more
distant mountains bounding the Campanian plain on the east.</p>

<p>We can hardly believe that the construction of a water channel
for so great a distance lay within the resources of so small
a town. We find, however, the remains of a great aqueduct
which, starting near Avellino, a dozen miles east of Nola,
skirted the base of Vesuvius on the north and extended westward,
furnishing water not only to Naples but also to Puteoli,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Baiae, and Misenum. This ancient structure drew from the
same springs, and followed substantially the same route, as the
new aqueduct which since 1885 has been bringing water to
Naples. No inscription in regard to it has been found, and
there is no reference to it in ancient books. The remains&mdash;of
which the longest section, known as Ponti Rossi, 'Red
Bridges,' may be seen near Naples&mdash;seem to indicate two
styles of construction, extensive repairs having been made after
the aqueduct had been partly destroyed; but up to the present
time it has not been possible to determine the period to which
they belong.</p>

<p>The water system of Pompeii goes back to the time before
the founding of the Roman colony. This is evident, not only
from the arrangements of the older baths, which contemplated
a freer use of water than could well have been provided
by cisterns, but also from the existence of three marble supports
for fountain basins, which, as shown by their style of
workmanship, the use of Oscan letters as mason's marks, and
their location in pre-Roman buildings&mdash;the temple of Apollo,
the Forum Triangulare, and the house of the Faun&mdash;belonged
to the earlier period. If we may ascribe the building of the
great aqueduct to the time of peace and prosperity in Campania
between the Second Punic War and the Social War, and suppose
that Pompeii, joining with other towns in its construction,
was supplied by a branch from it, we have a simple and
highly probable solution of the problem. Nothing in the character
of the masonry requires us to assign the aqueduct to a
later date.</p>

<p class="p2">The shrines along the streets, with few exceptions, were
dedicated to the guardian deities presiding over thoroughfares,
particularly the gods of street crossings, <i>Lares Compitales</i>. The
worship of these divinities in Rome was reorganized by Augustus
and placed in charge of the precinct wardens, <i>vicorum magistri</i>,
who were to see that the worship of his guardian spirit, Genius,
was associated with that of the Lares at each shrine. The
arrangements at the Capital were naturally followed by the
colonies and other cities under Roman rule.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span></p>

<p>At Pompeii the shrines of the street gods differ greatly in
size and character. Sometimes there is a small altar against
the side of a building, with two large serpents, personifications
of the Genius of the place, painted on the wall near it; one of
the serpents, with a conspicuous crest, represents a male, the
other, a female.</p>

<p>Frequently the place of the altar is taken by a niche, in
which the passer-by could deposit his offering. In our illustration
(<a href="#fig105">Fig. 105</a>) we see an ancient street altar which was
carefully preserved when the Central Baths were built, a niche
being made over it in the new wall.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 105.&mdash;Ancient altar in new wall, southeast corner of the Central Baths.</p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes a large altar is found, and the Lares, with their
offerings, are painted on a wall above it. Such a shrine may
be seen at the northwest corner of Stabian and Nola streets,
between the fountain and the water tower (<a href="#fig103">Fig. 103</a>). Back of
the altar is a wall terminating in a gable (the tiles are modern)
on which was a painted altar with four worshippers clad in togas,
and a fluteplayer, the inseparable accompaniment of a Roman
sacrificial scene; at the sides were the two Lares, represented as
youths, in loose tunics confined by a girdle, holding in one hand,
high uplifted, a drinking horn (<i>rhyton</i>), from which a jet of wine
flows into a small pail (<i>situla</i>) in the other hand. It is remarkable
that we do not find in this or similar paintings at Pompeii,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
any figure representing the Genius of the emperor, while in
private houses the Genius of the proprietor often has a place
with the Lares, and sometimes the Genius of the emperor also;
in theory at least, as already remarked (<a href="#Page_104">p. 104</a>), the emperor
stood to all men in the relation that the master of a house bore
to the household.</p>

<a href="images/fig106fs.jpg">View larger image</a></p>
</div>

<p>There is also a small chapel for the worship of the street
gods on the west side of Stabian Street, near
Abbondanza Street. As may be seen from
the accompanying plan (<a href="#fig106">Fig. 106</a>), at the left
as you enter is a bench of masonry (1), at the
rear a long altar (2). In the wall at the right
is a niche for the bronze or terra cotta figures
of the Lares and the Genius, while the surface
of the altar is divided into two parts, for the
separate worship of the same divinities. A
similar chapel is situated on the west side of
Mercury Street (VI. viii. 14). Here also we find a bench of
masonry, with two niches above it; in the middle was a block
of limestone which may have been used as an altar. At the
rear is a door leading into a small back room. This chapel was
formerly thought to be a barber shop.</p>

<p>It has been customary to assign to the street gods all of the
shrines at the side of the street. Occasionally, however, other
divinities were thus honored; and the only street altar found
with an inscription is consecrated to a different deity. This
altar is near Nola Street, on the east side of Insula IX. vii. On
the wall above two cornucopias are painted the words <i>Salutei
sacrum</i>, 'Sacred to Salus'; the goddess of health was worshipped
here.</p>

<p>Near the upper end of the Forum, on the north side of Insula
VII. vii, is another altar, above which is a stucco relief representing
a sacrifice; at the sides of the relief are pilasters, and
over it a gable, in which an eagle is seen. This indicates that
the shrine was dedicated to Jupiter.</p>

<p>The largest of the street altars, of tufa, stands free in a vaulted
niche on the north side of Insula VIII. ii, but no traces of painting
are to be seen near it (<a href="#fig107">Fig. 107</a>).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span></p>

<p>Various divinities are painted on the outside of houses. The
largest picture of this kind is at the corner of Abbondanza
Street, on the east side of Insula VIII. iii. It contains figures
of the twelve gods, distinguished by their attributes&mdash;Vesta,
Diana, Apollo, Ceres, Minerva, Jupiter, Juno, Vulcan, Venus
Pompeiana, Mars, Neptune,
and Mercury. Underneath
are the two serpents,
facing each other,
on either side of a painted
altar; near the altar are
other figures that cannot
be plainly distinguished,
probably of men offering
sacrifice. This is not a
shrine&mdash;there is no place
for the offerings. The
owner of the property
(house of the Boar), desired
to place his household
under the protection
of these gods, perhaps
also to preserve the corner
from defilement.
We often find roughly
sketched figures of single
gods, to the guardian
care of whom the master of a house wished to commit his interests&mdash;most
frequently Mercury, the patron divinity of traders,
and Bacchus; but also Jupiter, Minerva, and Hercules.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 107.&mdash;Large street altar.</p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes merely a pair of serpents are painted on a wall, in
order to give a religious association to the place, as a means of
protection. In one case (east side of Insula VII. xi. 12) an
explicit warning was painted on the plaster beside them: <i>Otiosis
locus hic non est; discede, morator</i>,&mdash;'No place for loafers here;
move along!'

<h3>CHAPTER XXXII<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE DEFENCES OF THE CITY</i></span></h3>

<p>From the military point of view, Pompeii at the time of the
eruption did not possess a system of defences. For many years
previously the city wall had been kept in repair only as a convenience
in matters of civil administration, and the gates had
long since lost all appearance of preparedness to resist attack.
The fortifications are not, however, without interest. They
form a massive and conspicuous portion of the ruins, and as
a survival from an earlier period they have recorded many
evidences of the successive changes through which the city
passed.</p>

<p>The relation of the wall to the configuration of the height on
which Pompeii stood was pointed out in connection with our
general survey of the city (<a href="#Page_31">p. 31</a>). Along the southwest side, at
the time of the eruption, it had almost completely disappeared.
Here, where the slope was steepest and the city best defended
by nature, the wall had been removed, and its place occupied
by houses, at a comparatively early date, probably in the second
century <span class="s08">B.C.</span>; enough fragments remain, however, to enable us
to determine its location with certainty. Elsewhere the greater
part of the wall is in a fair state of preservation. The towers
did not belong to the original structure, and one of the gates in
its present form is of still more recent origin.</p>

<p>The construction of the wall will be readily understood with
the help of the accompanying illustrations.</p>

<p>First, two parallel stone walls were built, about 15 feet apart
and 28 inches thick; both walls were strengthened on the side
toward the city by numerous buttresses, the inner wall being
further supported by massive abutments projecting into the
space between (<a href="#fig108">Fig. 108</a>). This space was filled with earth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span></p>

<p>When the desired height, 26 or 28 feet, was reached, a breastwork
of parapets was constructed on the outer wall; the inner
wall was carried up about 16 feet above the broad passageway
on the top (<a href="#fig110">Fig. 110</a>) as a shield against the weapons of the
enemy, preventing the missiles from going over into the town
and causing them to fall where the garrison could easily pick
them up to hurl back again. Rain water falling on the top
flowed toward the outside, and was carried beyond the face of
the masonry by stone waterspouts.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 334px;"><a name="fig108" id="fig108"></a>
<img src="images/fig108.jpg" width="334" height="124" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 108.&mdash;Plan of a section of the city wall.<br />

<li>A. Inner wall with buttresses and abutments.</li>
<li>B. Outer wall.</li>
<li>C. Filling of earth between the stone walls.</li>
<li>D. Tower.</li>
<li>E. Stairs leading to the top of the wall.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>For additional strength there was heaped against the inner
wall an embankment of earth, which still remains on the north
side, between the tenth
and twelfth towers. At
the right of the Herculaneum
Gate the
place of the embankment
and of the inner
wall was taken by a
massive stairway (E
in <a href="#fig108">Fig. 108</a>) leading to
the top. Originally,
the stairs extended east
about 270 feet, but afterwards they were demolished for the
greater part of the distance, and houses were built close to
the wall. There is a smaller stairway of the same kind east of
the Stabian Gate (<a href="#fig111">Fig. 111</a>).</p>

<p>In the original structure both outer and inner walls were
built of hewn blocks of tufa and limestone; but we find portions
of the outer wall, and all the towers, of lava rubble, the surface
of which was covered with stucco. The towers were already
standing, as shown by inscriptions, at the time of the Social
War. We are therefore safe in believing that in the period of
peace following the Second Punic War the walls were not kept
in repair, some parts of the outer wall being utilized as a quarry
for building stone; that with the advent of the Social War they
were hastily repaired on the north, east, and south sides, and
strengthened by towers, but that no attempt was made to renew
the fortifications on the steep southwest side, between the Herculaneum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
Gate and the Forum Triangulare, where the line of
the old wall was covered with buildings.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig109" id="fig109"></a>
<img src="images/fig109.jpg" width="339" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 109.&mdash;View of the city wall, inside, where the embankment has been removed. The
door in the tower at the left marks the height of the embankment.</p>
</div>

<p>When the towers were added&mdash;probably not long before
90 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>&mdash;they were not distributed evenly along the wall, but
were placed where they seemed to be most needed. The
western portion of the ridge between the Herculaneum and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
Capua Gates was particularly favorable for the approach of
an enemy; hence three towers were built near together here,
numbered 10, 11, and 12 on <a href="#plan1">Plan I</a>. Another part of the
wall especially exposed was on the southeast side, where
the height covered by the city slopes gradually down to the
plain; and we find five towers within a comparatively short
distance, two east of the Amphitheatre, the other three further
south. On the north side, between the Capua and Sarno
gates, the slope is steeper and two towers were thought to be
sufficient.</p>

<p>That there were once two additional towers, besides the ten
that have been enumerated, is evident from several Oscan
inscriptions, painted in red letters on the street walls of houses.
One of them, near the southwest corner of the house of the
Faun, reads thus: 'This way leads between Towers 10 and 11,
where Titus Fisanius is in command.' The street referred to
runs between the tenth and twelfth Insulae of Region VI, direct
to the city wall. Two others refer to a 'Tower 12' near the
Herculaneum Gate, this part of the fortifications being in charge
of Maras Adirius.</p>

<p>In a fourth inscription we read: 'This way leads between
the houses of Maras Castricius and of Maras Spurnius, where
Vibius Seximbrius is in command.' In 1897, a fifth inscription
became visible on the north side of Insula VIII. v-vi, where it
had been concealed by a coat of plaster: 'This way leads to
the city building (and) to Minerva.' The street referred to is
seemingly the blind alley which formerly ran through the insula
(<a href="#plan1">Plan I</a>). If this is correct, the sanctuary of Minerva is the
Doric temple in the Forum Triangulare; but the 'city building'
cannot be identified.</p>

<p>The five inscriptions evidently date from the siege of Sulla;
they were intended for the information of the soldiers, belonging
to the army of the Allies, who were quartered in the city to
assist in its defence. At this time there must have been twelve
towers, that near the Herculaneum Gate being reckoned last in
the enumeration, as in <a href="#plan1">Plan I</a>; but the location of the two that
have disappeared has not been determined. Another suggestive
reminder of the same siege is the name <span class="smcap">L · SVLA</span>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
scratched by a soldier in the stucco on the inside of Tower 10,
near a loophole.</p>

<p>The towers, which measure approximately 31 by 25 feet,
were built in two
stories, with strong
vaulted ceilings.
The floor of the second
story was on a
level with the top of
the wall, and over
this story was a terrace
with battlements,
as shown in
<a href="#fig110">Fig. 110</a>; the roof
seen on the two
towers in <a href="#fig101">Fig. 101</a>
was a later addition,
made when the city
walls were no longer
needed as a means
of defence. Stairways on the inside gave ready access to the
lower part of the towers, which could be entered from the city
by a door (<a href="#fig109">Fig. 109</a>) opening on the embankment. On the outside
were loopholes. Below, at the right, was a sally port, placed
thus in order that the soldiers when rushing forth might present
their shields to the enemy, leaving the right hand free to use
with offensive weapons; when returning to the wall they would,
if possible, cut their way to the sally port in the next tower to
the right, so as to avoid the danger of exposing their right sides
to the enemy.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 362px;"><a name="fig110" id="fig110"></a>
<img src="images/fig110.jpg" width="362" height="334" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 110.&mdash;Tower of the city wall, restored.</p>
</div>

<p>Four of the gates have been excavated, the Porta Marina and
the Stabian, Nola and Herculaneum gates; two others, the
Vesuvius and Sarno gates, have been partly exposed to view.
The remaining two are still completely covered. All bear evidence
of extensive repairs, and one of them, the Herculaneum
Gate, was entirely rebuilt at a comparatively late period; with
this exception, however, they seem to have assumed their present
form in the Tufa Period. Three of them still retain traces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
of decoration of the first style on the inner parts. The different
gateways enter the walls at various angles.</p>

<p>The Stabian Gate may be taken as typical. Entering from
the outside, at A, one came through a vaulted passage, B, about
twelve feet wide, to a
broad middle passage,
or vantage court, open
to the sky, into which
missiles and boiling
pitch could be hurled
from above upon the
heads of an enemy attempting
to force the
gates; then followed a
second vaulted passage,
a little wider than
the other, in which were
hung the heavy double
doors, opening outward.
The projecting
posts of the doors
are preserved, as are also the stones on which they rested
when they were swung back against the wall; the vaulting has
been restored. The gateway was paved throughout, with a
raised walk on the right side. On one side of the inner entrance
is a well (<i>a</i>), the Gorgon's head upon the curb reminding
one of the protectress of the gate; on the other, the flight of
steps already mentioned (<i>b</i>) leads to the top of the wall. Just
beyond the steps are the remains of a small building, perhaps
the lodge of the gate keeper (<i>c</i>).</p>

</div>

<p>The patron divinity of city gates, Minerva, was probably
honored with a small statue in the niche still to be seen in the
wall of the vantage court. Two inscriptions commemorate the
making of repairs on the thoroughfare passing under the gateway.
One of them (at <i>d</i>) is the Oscan inscription recording
the work of the aediles Sittius and Pontius, to which reference
has already been made (<a href="#Page_184">p. 184</a>). The other (at <i>e</i>) is in Latin,
and of much later date. It informs us that the duumvirs L.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
Avianius Flaccus and Q. Spedius Firmus at their own expense
paved the road 'from the milestone,' which must have been
near the gate, 'to the station of the gig drivers (<i>cisiarios</i>), at
the limits of the territory of the Pompeians.' The Roman gigs,
<i>cisia</i>, were very light, and adapted for rapid travelling; they
were drawn by horses or mules, and were kept for hire at
stations along the highways. The site of the station between
Pompeii and Stabiae is not known.</p>

<p>The Nola Gate, and the partially excavated Vesuvius and
Sarno gates, follow the plan just described in all essential particulars.
The inner keystone of the Nola Gate, facing the city,
is ornamented with a helmeted head of Minerva, in high relief,
which being of tufa has suffered from exposure to the weather.
There was once an Oscan inscription near by, which stated that
the chief executive officer of the city, Vibius Popidius, let the
contract for building this gate, and accepted the structure from
the contractor.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p>The front of the Porta
Marina has the appearance
of a tower projecting from
the wall. The gateway
consists simply of two
vaulted entrances, of unequal
width; one for vehicles,
the other, at the left,
for pedestrians. Both were
closed by doors. In the
niche at the right of the
wider passage the lower
part of a terra cotta statue of Minerva was found. There was
no vantage court, no inner passage; but in the early years of
the Roman colony the steep lower end of the Via Marina for a
distance of 70 feet was covered with a vaulted roof, which still
remains. Opening into this corridor on the right is a long narrow
room, which formed a part of the foundations of the court of
the temple of Venus Pompeiana, and is now used as a Museum.</p>

<p>This gate in its present form could hardly have been intended
for defence; it was adapted rather for administrative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
purposes, and must have been built&mdash;probably in the place of
an earlier structure&mdash;in a period when the possibility of war
seemed remote. Such a time, as previously remarked, was the
second century <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, particularly the latter half, after the destruction
of Carthage.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 113.&mdash;Herculaneum Gate, looking down the Street of Tombs.</p>

<p>The corners of the entrances are opus mixtum, a course of brick-shaped blocks of stone
alternating with three courses of bricks.</p>
</div>

<p>A still more peaceful aspect is presented by the Herculaneum
Gate. The style of masonry&mdash;rubble work with <i>opus mixtum</i>
at the corners&mdash;points to the end of the Republic, rather than
to the Empire, as the period of construction. Here we find
three vaulted passages, the middle one for vehicles, those on
either side for pedestrians. The vaulting over the middle part
of the gate has disappeared; but according to appearances a vantage
court was left here, in the middle passage, if not in those at
the sides; at the inner end of this court the gates were placed.
The greater part of the structure served no purpose of utility; it
was obviously designed as a monumental entrance to the city.

<h2>PART II<br />

THE HOUSES</h2>

<h3 class="chap1">CHAPTER XXXIII<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE POMPEIAN HOUSE</i></span></h3>

<p>Our chief sources of information regarding the domestic
architecture of ancient Italy are two,&mdash;the treatise of Vitruvius,
and the remains found at Pompeii. The Pompeian houses present
many variations from the plan described by the Roman
architect; yet in essential particulars there is no disagreement,
and it is not difficult to form a clear conception of their arrangements.</p>

<p>The houses of Greco-Roman antiquity differed from those of
modern times in several respects. They took their light and air
from the inside, the apartments being grouped about a court or
about a large central room which ordinarily had an opening in
the ceiling; the distribution of space being thus made on a different
principle, the large rooms were often larger, the small rooms
smaller and more numerous than in modern dwellings of corresponding
size; and in the better houses the decoration of both
walls and floors was more permanent than is usual in our day.
The ancient houses were relatively low, in most cases, if we
except the crowded tenements of imperial Rome, not exceeding
two stories. The windows in the outside walls were generally
few and small, and the external appearance was not unlike that
of Oriental houses of the present time. In the city house the
large front entrance was frequently ornamented with carved
posts and lintel.</p>

<p>The development of the Italic house can be traced at Pompeii
over a period of almost four hundred years. The earlier form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
consisted of a single series of apartments,&mdash;a central room,
<i>atrium</i>, with smaller rooms opening into it, and a garden at the
rear; an example is the house of the Surgeon (<a href="#Page_280">p. 280</a>). A restoration
of such a house with its high atrium, wide front door,
and garden is shown in <a href="#fig114">Fig. 114</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig114" id="fig114"></a>
<img src="images/fig114.jpg" width="518" height="492" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 114.&mdash;Early Pompeian house, restored.</p>
</div>

<p>Later, under Greek influence, a court with a colonnade and
surrounding rooms was added. This was called <i>peristylium</i>,
'peristyle'; it is simply the more elaborate inner part of the
Greek house, <i>andronitis</i>, joined to the dwelling of Italic origin.
We find the union of atrium and peristyle with their respective
groups of apartments fully accomplished in the second century
<span class="s08">B.C.</span>, the Tufa Period; the type of dwelling thus developed remained
in vogue during Roman times and is often called the
Roman house.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span></p>

<p>The double origin is clearly indicated by the names of the
rooms. Those of the front part are designated by Latin words,&mdash;<i>atrium</i>,
<i>fauces</i>, <i>ala</i>, <i>tablinum</i>; but the apartments at the rear
bear Greek names,&mdash;<i>peristylium</i>, <i>triclinium</i>, <i>oecus</i>, <i>exedra</i>. In
large houses both atrium and peristyle were sometimes duplicated.</p>

<p>The houses of Pompeii impress the visitor as having been designed
primarily for summer use. The arrangements contemplate
the spending of much time in the open air, and pains was
taken to furnish protection from the heat, not from the cold.
The greater part of the area is taken up by colonnades, gardens,
and courts; from this point of view the atrium may be classed
as a court. The living rooms had high ceilings. In summer
they were cool and airy, in winter difficult to heat; they were
dark and close when the door was shut, cold when it was open.</p>

<p>With a single exception the arrangements for heating so often
met with in the remains of houses discovered in northern countries
are found at Pompeii only in connection with bath-rooms;
the cold was ineffectively combated by means of braziers. We
are led to believe that the Pompeians were extremely sensitive
to heat, but endured cold with great patience. One who makes
himself familiar with the arrangements of Italian houses to-day
will receive a similar impression, although the peculiarity is perhaps
less obvious than in the case of the ancient dwellings.</p>

<p>In describing the Pompeian houses it is more convenient to
designate the principal rooms by the ancient names. In <a href="#fig115">Fig. 115</a>
we present an ideal plan; in it the names are given to the parts
of the house, the relative location of which is subject to comparatively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
little variation. These parts will first be discussed; then
those will be taken up which present a greater diversity in their
arrangements.</p>

<h4>I. <span class="smcap">Vestibule, Fauces, and Front Door</span></h4>

<p>The <i>vestibulum</i> was the space between the front door and the
street. The derivation of the word (<i>ve-</i> + the root of <i>stare</i>, 'to
stand aside') suggests the purpose; the vestibule was a place
where one could step aside from the bustle and confusion of the
street. In many houses there was no vestibule, the front door
opening directly on the sidewalk; and where vestibules did exist
at Pompeii, they were much more modest than those belonging
to the houses of wealthy Romans, to which reference is so frequently
made in classical writers. Roman vestibules were often
supported by columns of costly marbles, and adorned with statues
and other works of art. Only one vestibule at Pompeii was
treated as a portico, that of the house of the Vestals near the
Herculaneum Gate. This was once as wide as the atrium, the
roof being carried by four columns; but before the destruction
of the city two partitions were built parallel with the sides dividing
it into three parts, a narrow vestibule of the ordinary type,
with a shop at the right and at the left.</p>

<p>The passage inside the front door was called <i>fauces</i>, or <i>prothyron</i>.
According to Vitruvius the width of it in the case of
large atriums should be half, in smaller atriums two thirds, that
of the tablinum; at Pompeii the width is generally less than half.
In the houses of the Tufa Period the corners of the fauces where
it opens into the atrium were ornamented with pilasters connected
at the top by an entablature.</p>

<p>The vestibule and fauces were ordinarily of the same width,
and were separated by projecting doorposts with a slightly raised
threshold (<a href="#fig116">Fig. 116</a>) and heavy double doors. Sometimes, as in
the house of Epidius Rufus, there was in addition a small door
at the side of the vestibule opening into a narrow passage connecting
with the fauces (<a href="#fig149">Fig. 149</a>). In such cases the folding
doors, which on account of their size and the method of hanging
must always have been hard to open, were generally kept shut.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
They would be thrown back early in the morning for the reception
of clients, and on special occasions; at other times the more
convenient small door would be used.</p>

<p>In several instances the volcanic dust so hardened about the
lower part of a front door that it has been possible to make a
cast by pouring soft plaster of Paris into the cavity left by the
crumbling away of the wood; there are several of these casts in
the little Museum at Pompeii. With their help, and with the
well preserved stone thresholds before us, it is possible to picture
to ourselves the appearance of the doorway.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig116" id="fig116"></a>
<img src="images/fig116.jpg" width="449" height="406" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 116.&mdash;Plan and section of the vestibule, threshold, and fauces of the house of Pansa.<br />
<a href="images/fig116fs.jpg">View larger image</a></p>
</div>

<p>The doorposts were protected by wooden casings, <i>antepagmenta</i>,
which were made fast at the bottom by means of holes
in the threshold (<i>α, α</i> in <a href="#fig116">Fig. 116</a>).</p>

<p>The folding doors swung on pivots, which were fitted into
sockets in the threshold (<i>β, β</i>) and in the lintel. The pivots
were of wood, but were provided&mdash;at least the lower ones&mdash;with
a cylindrical cap of iron or bronze, and the socket had
a protective lining of the same metal. Both caps and sockets,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
especially those of bronze, are found in the thresholds in a
good state of preservation. It seems strange that ancient
builders did not use smaller pivots of solid metal, on which the
doors would have turned much more easily; but a conservative
tradition in this regard prevailed against innovation.</p>

<p>The fastenings were elaborate. Near the inner edge of each
door was a vertical bolt, which shot into a hole in the threshold
(γ, γ); there was probably a corresponding bolt at the top,
as in the case of large modern doors. Sometimes there was a
heavy iron lock, turned with a key, and also an iron bar which
was fastened across the crack in such a way as to tie the two folds
together. In many houses there are holes in the walls of the
fauces, just back of the door, in which at night a strong wooden
bar, <i>sera</i>, was placed; hardly less often we find a hole in the
floor a few feet back, in which one end of a slanting prop was
set, the other end being braced against the middle of the door.
These arrangements bring to mind Juvenal's vivid picture of the
disturbances and dangers of the streets of Rome at night.</p>

<h4>II. <span class="smcap">The Atrium</span></h4>

<p>An atrium completely covered by a roof was extremely rare.
With few exceptions, there was a large rectangular opening
over the middle, <i>compluvium</i>, toward which the roof sloped
from all sides (<a href="#fig114">Figs. 114</a>, <a href="#fig118">118</a>). In the floor, directly under the
compluvium, was a shallow basin, <i>impluvium</i>, into which the
rain water fell (<i>h</i> in <a href="#fig118">Fig. 118</a>). The impluvium had two outlets.
One was connected with the cistern; a round cistern mouth,
<i>puteal</i>, ornamented with carving, often stood near the edge of
the basin, as in the house of the Tragic Poet (<a href="#fig153">Fig. 153</a>). The
other outlet led under the floor to the street in front, carrying
off the overflow when the cistern was full, and also the water
used in cleaning the floor. In the better houses a fountain was
often placed in the middle of the impluvium.</p>

<p>Vitruvius (VI. iii. 1 <i>et seq.</i>) mentions five kinds of atriums,
the basis of classification being the construction of the roof&mdash;Tuscan,
tetrastyle, Corinthian, displuviate, and tortoise atriums.
The first three are well illustrated at Pompeii.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span></p>

<p>The Tuscan atrium, supposed by the Romans to have been
derived from the Etruscans, was apparently the native Italic
form. Two heavy girders were placed across the room, above
the ends of the impluvium (<a href="#fig117">Fig. 117</a>, <i>b</i>). On these, two shorter
crossbeams were laid (<i>c</i>), over the sides of the impluvium. The
corners of the rectangular frame thus made were connected
with the walls at the corners of the atrium by four strong slanting
beams (<a href="#fig117">Figs. 117</a>, <a href="#fig118">118</a>, <i>e</i>). On these and on the frame were
placed the lower ends of the
sloping rafters (<a href="#fig117">Fig. 117</a>, <i>f</i>),
carrying the tiles, the arrangement
of which can be seen in
<a href="#fig114">Figs. 114</a>, <a href="#fig117">117</a>, and <a href="#fig118">118</a>. This
was the most common arrangement
of the roof at Pompeii.</p>

<li>2. Semicylindrical tiles for covering the joints, <i>imbrices</i>.</li>
<li>3. Gutter tiles.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The edge of the compluvium
was frequently ornamented with
terra cotta waterspouts, representing
the heads of animals.
In a house near the Porta Marina
the projecting foreparts of dogs
and lions were used in place of
the heads; the remains of a part
of the compluvium have been
put together again, and are seen
in <a href="#fig119">Fig. 119</a>. The lions were
placed over the larger spouts
at the four corners; the under
side of the spouts surmounted by the dogs and lions was ornamented
with acanthus leaves in relief. The same illustration
presents an example of the antefixes sometimes found.</p>

<p>The tetrastyle atrium differed from the Tuscan in only one
respect: there were four columns supporting the roof, one at
each corner of the impluvium. In most cases these supports,
which interfered with the view of the interior, can hardly have
been intended primarily for ornament; they simplified the construction,
making the ceiling and roof firm without the use of
the heavy and expensive girders.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span></p>

<p>The Corinthian atrium had a larger compluvium than the
other kinds, the roof being supported by a number of columns.
There are three examples at Pompeii, the houses of Epidius
Rufus with sixteen columns (<a href="#Page_310">p. 310</a>), of Castor and Pollux with
twelve, and of the Fullonica with six.</p>

<p>The roof of the displuviate atrium sloped from the middle
toward the sides, the water being carried off by lead pipes.
The aperture for the admission of light and air was relatively
much higher above the floor
than in the kinds previously
described. No example of
this type has been found at
Pompeii.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p>The tortoise atrium,
<i>atrium testudinatum</i>, was
small and without a compluvium.
The roof had a
pyramidal shape. There
were possibly a few examples
at Pompeii, as we may
infer from the occasional
absence of an impluvium;
in the only instance, however,
in which it is possible to determine the form of the roof
(V. v. 1-2), this must have been very different from that referred
to by the Roman writer (<a href="#Page_343">p. 343</a>).</p>

<p>Vitruvius says further that the atrium should have an oblong
shape, the width being three fifths or two thirds of the length,
or measured on the side of a square, the hypothenuse of which
is taken for the length. The design was obviously to bring
the sides nearer together, thus lessening the strain on the two
girders which in the commonest form were used to sustain the
roof. The height, to the frame of the compluvium, should be
three fourths of the width.</p>

<p>In the case of the tetrastyle and Corinthian atriums at Pompeii
the height is indicated by that of the columns, but there are
rarely adequate data for determining the height of the others
with exactness. In regard to length and breadth the proportions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
harmonize fairly well with those recommended by Vitruvius;
but the height, in the cases in which it can be ascertained,
is often greater than that contemplated by the rules of the
architect.</p>

<p>Looking at the Pompeian atriums in their present condition
(<a href="#plate07">Plate VII</a>, <a href="#fig121">Figs. 121</a>, <a href="#fig153">153</a>) one might easily receive the impression
that they were primarily courts rather than rooms. In this
respect the restorations of Roman houses in the older books are
often at fault, the atrium being generally represented as too low
in comparison with the rooms around it.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig119" id="fig119"></a>
<img src="images/fig119.jpg" width="573" height="288" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 119.&mdash;Corner of a compluvium with waterspouts and antefixes, reconstructed.</p>
</div>

<p>The references in the ancient writers uniformly point to this
as the principal room of the house. In the earliest times the
hearth stood here; a hole in the roof served as a chimney. The
accumulation of soot on the ceiling and the walls suggested
the characteristic name 'black room'; for <i>atrium</i> comes from
<i>ater</i>, 'black.' Here the household gathered at mealtime; here
they worked, or rested from their labors. In the atrium Lucretia
sat with her maids spinning late at night when her husband
entered unexpectedly with his friends.</p>

<p>Such the atrium remained in farmhouses to the latest times.
The name meanwhile was transferred to the corresponding
apartment of elegant city homes, while in the country it went
out of use, being replaced by <i>culina</i>, 'kitchen,' on account of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
the presence of the hearth. In such a room in his Sabine villa
Horace loved to dine, conversing on topics grave or gay with
his rustic neighbors, and partaking of the simple fare with
relish; while his slaves, freed from the restraints of city life,
were permitted to eat at the same time, sitting at a separate
table. The remains of an atrium of this kind, with its hearth
and niche for the images of the household gods, may be seen in
the villa recently excavated near Boscoreale (<a href="#Page_361">p. 361</a>).</p>

<p>Without doubt some houses of the ancient type might be
found in cities, even in Rome, as late as the end of the Republic.
We read of one in Cicero's time in the atrium of which
spinning was done. But at Pompeii the hearth had been banished
from the atrium at a comparatively early date, in the
Tufa Period if not before; and the room was made uncomfortable
to sit in, for a considerable part of the year, by the
broad opening of the compluvium.</p>

<p>From the architectural point of view, however, the atrium
never lost its significance as the central apartment. In all its
dimensions, but particularly in height, it presents so great a
contrast with the rooms around it as to remind us of the relation
of a Roman Catholic church to the chapels at the sides.
The impression of spaciousness was perhaps deepened when
the atrium was provided with a ceiling. Few traces of such
ceilings are found at Pompeii, and in the smaller houses the
inside of the roof seems generally to have been visible.</p>

<p>The atrium of the Corinthian type most nearly resembled a
court, on account of the size of the opening to the sky and the
use of many columns. A suggestion of the un-Italic character
of this type appears in the name; for one can scarcely suppose
that atriums in the strict sense existed at Corinth.</p>

<p>Although the Pompeian atriums show no traces of a hearth,
there is possibly a reminiscence of the ancient arrangement
in the <i>gartibulum</i>, a table which we frequently find at the rear
of the impluvium. Varro says that since his boyhood these
tables, on which vessels of bronze were placed, had gone out
of use; at Pompeii they remained in fashion much longer. The
gartibulum with its bronze vases may symbolize the ancient
hearth with the cooking utensils. Possibly, however, it represents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
the kitchen table near the hearth on which the dishes
were washed; that it may have served a similar purpose in
later times is evident from the fact that in front of it a marble
pedestal was often placed for a statuette which threw a jet of
water into a marble basin at the edge of the impluvium. This
group of table, fountain figure, and basin appears in many
Pompeian atriums. In <a href="#plate07">Plate VII</a> we see the gartibulum and
the supports of the marble-basin, but the base of the fountain
figure has disappeared.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 270px;"><a name="fig120" id="fig120"></a>
<img src="images/fig120.jpg" width="267" height="214" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 120.&mdash;A Pompeian's strong box, <i>arca</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>The strong box of the master of the house, <i>arca</i>, often stood
in the atrium, usually against one of the side walls. It was
sometimes adorned with reliefs,
as the one shown in
<a href="#fig120">Fig. 120</a>, which is now in the
Naples Museum. It stood on
a heavy block of stone, or low
foundation of masonry, to
which it was attached by an
iron rod passing down through
the bottom. A wealthy Pompeian
sometimes had more
than one of these chests.</p>

<p>In three atriums the herm
of the proprietor stands at the rear. One, with the portrait of
Cornelius Rufus, is shown in <a href="#fig121">Fig. 121</a>.</p>

<p>When there were two atriums in a house, the larger was more
elaborately furnished than the other, and was set aside for the
public or official life of the proprietor; the smaller one was used
for domestic purposes. Typical examples are found in the
houses of the Faun and of the Labyrinth. In the former the
principal atrium is of the Tuscan type, the other tetrastyle; in
the latter the large atrium is tetrastyle, the smaller Tuscan.</p>

<h4>III. <span class="smcap">The Tablinum</span></h4>

<p>The tablinum was a large room at the rear of the atrium,
opening into the latter with its whole width; the connection of
the two rooms is clearly shown in <a href="#plate07">Plate VII</a> and <a href="#fig121">Fig. 121</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
According to Vitruvius, when the atrium was 30 to 40 feet
in width&mdash;as in the larger Pompeian houses&mdash;the tablinum
should be half as wide; when the atrium was smaller, the width
of the tablinum should be two thirds that of the atrium, while
the height at the entrance should be nine eighths, and inside
four thirds of the width. These proportions will not hold
good for Pompeii, where the tablinum is generally narrower
and higher (Vitr. VI. iv. 5, 6).</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig121" id="fig121"></a>
<img src="images/fig121.jpg" width="545" height="421" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 121.&mdash;Atrium of the house of Cornelius Rufus, looking through the tablinum and

In the foreground, the impluvium, with the carved supports of a marble table; at the left,
between the entrances to the andron and the tablinum, the herm of Rufus.</p>
</div>

<p>The posts at the entrance were usually treated as pilasters,
joined above by a cornice; architecturally the front of this room
formed the most impressive feature of the atrium. Between the
pilasters hung portières, which might be drawn back and fastened
at the sides. In the house of the Silver Wedding the
fastenings were found in place,&mdash;bronze disks from which a
ship's beak projected, attached to the pilasters.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span></p>

<p>In early times the tablinum ordinarily had an opening at the
rear also, but this was not so high as that in front, and could be
closed by broad folding doors. In winter the doors were probably
kept shut. In summer they were left open and the room,
cool and airy, served as a dining room, a use which harmonizes
well with a passage of Varro explaining the derivation of the
name. "In the olden time," says this writer, "people used to
take their meals in the winter by the hearth; in summer they
ate out of doors, country folk in the court, city people in the
<i>tabulinum</i>, which we understand to have been a summer house
built of boards." The derivation of <i>tabulinum</i>, of which <i>tablinum</i>
is a shortened form, from <i>tabula</i>, 'a board,' is obvious.</p>

<p>The period to which Varro refers antedates that of the oldest
houses at Pompeii. The room which we call tablinum was then
a deep recess at the rear of the atrium, open at the front, as
now, but enclosed by a wall at the rear; against this wall was a
veranda opening into the garden, toward which the board roof
sloped. People took their meals in the veranda in summer, and
to it the name tablinum was naturally applied. In the recess
at the rear of the atrium, corresponding to the later tablinum,
was the bed of the master of the house, called <i>lectus adversus</i>
because 'facing' one who entered the front door. As late as
the reign of Augustus, long after it became the custom to set
aside a closed apartment for the family room, a reminiscence of
the ancient arrangement still remained in the couch which stood
at the rear of the atrium or in the tablinum, which was called
<i>lectus adversus</i>, or even <i>lectus genialis</i>.</p>

<p>The removal of the hearth and the bed from the atrium must
have taken place when the small hole in the roof was replaced
by the compluvium. A broad opening was made in the rear
wall, and the place where the bed had been was turned into a
light, airy room; this was now used as a summer room instead of
the veranda, the name of which was in consequence transferred
to it.</p>

<p>Even in later times, when the houses were extended by the
addition, at the rear, of a peristyle with its group of apartments,
the tablinum may often have been used as a summer dining
room; but the tendency now was to withdraw the family life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
into the more secluded rooms about the peristyle. The tablinum,
lying between the front and the rear of the house, was
used as a reception room for guests who were not admitted into
the privacy of the home; and here undoubtedly the master of
the house received his clients.</p>

<p>In the house of the Vettii the tablinum is omitted on account
of the abundance of room; but at the rear of the atrium there
are wide openings into the peristyle (<a href="#fig158">Fig. 158</a>).</p>

<h4>IV. <span class="smcap">The Alae</span></h4>

<p>The alae, the 'wings' of the atrium, were two deep recesses
in the sides (<a href="#fig115">Fig. 115</a>). They were ordinarily at the rear, but
were sometimes placed at the middle, as in the house of Epidius
Rufus (<a href="#fig149">Fig. 149</a>). Vitruvius (VI. iv. 4) says that where the atrium
is from 30 to 40 feet long, one third of the length should be
taken for the breadth of the alae; in the case of larger atriums
the breadth of these rooms should be proportionally less, being
fixed at one fifth of the length for atriums from 80 to 100 feet
long; the height at the entrance should be equal to the breadth.</p>

<p>At Pompeii the alae, as the tablinum, are narrower and higher
than required by these proportions. In the Tufa Period the
entrances were ornamented with pilasters, and treated like the
broad entrance of the tablinum.</p>

<p>With reference to the purpose and uses of these rooms we
have no information beyond a remark of Vitruvius in regard to
placing the images of ancestors in them. This throws no light
upon their origin; for only a few noble families could have possessed
a sufficiently large number of ancestral busts or masks to
make it necessary to provide a special place for these, while the
alae form an essential and characteristic part of the Pompeian
house. Now and then an ala was used as a dining room; more
frequently, perhaps, one was utilized for a wardrobe, as may
be seen from the traces of the woodwork. A careful study of
the remains only deepens the impression that at Pompeii the
alae served no definite purpose, but were a survival from a previous
period, in which they responded to different conditions of
life.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span></p>

<p>An interesting parallel presents itself in the arrangements of
a type of peasants' house found in Lower Saxony. The main
entrance, as in the early Italic house, leads into a large and high
central room; at the sides of this and of the main entrance are
the living rooms and stalls. At the back the central room is
widened by two recesses corresponding with the alae; the hearth
stands against the rear wall. In the side walls, at the rear of
each recess, are a window and a door. The two windows admit
light to the part of the central room furthest from the entrance;
the doors open into the farmyard and the garden.</p>

<p>The Italic house in the beginning was not a city residence
shut in by party walls, but the isolated habitation of a countryman.
The design of the alae, as of the recesses in the Low
Saxon farmhouse, was to furnish light to the atrium, which, as
we have seen, was completely covered by a roof, there being
only a small hole to let out the smoke. The large windows in
the rear of the alae of the house of Sallust may be looked upon
as a survival; but in city houses generally light could not be
taken in this way from the sides. After the compluvium had
come into general use, a conservative tradition still retained the
alae whenever possible, though they no longer answered their
original purpose.</p>

<h4>V. <span class="smcap">The Rooms about the Atrium. The Andron</span></h4>

<p>In front there were rooms at either side of the entrance, ordinarily
fitted up as shops and opening on the street, but sometimes
used as dining rooms or sleeping rooms, or for other domestic
purposes.</p>

<p>On each side of the atrium were two or three small sleeping
rooms; in narrow houses these, as well as one or both of the
alae, were occasionally omitted.</p>

<p>At the rear were one or two rooms of the same depth as the
tablinum, used in most cases as dining rooms. They frequently
had a single broad entrance on the side of the peristyle or the
garden (<a href="#fig134">Fig. 134</a>, 22), but were sometimes entered by a door
from the atrium or from one of the alae (<a href="#fig115">Figs. 115</a>, <a href="#fig121">121</a>). The
door on the side of the atrium seems generally to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
made when the house was built; if the owner did not wish to
use it, it was walled up and treated as a blind door, an ornament
of the atrium.</p>

<p>The rooms about the atrium in the pre-Roman period were
made high, those in front and at the sides often measuring fifteen
feet to the edge of the ceiling, which had the form of a groined
vault. The rear rooms were still higher, the crown of the vaults
being as far above the floor as the flat ceiling of the tablinum.
A corresponding height was given to the doors; those in the
house of the Faun measure nearly fourteen feet. The upper
part of the doorway was doubtless pierced for the admission of
light in the manner indicated by wall paintings, and shown in
our restoration of one side of the atrium in the house of Sallust
(<a href="#fig261">Figs. 261</a>, <a href="#fig262">262</a>).</p>

<p>The andron was a passage at the right or the left of the tablinum,
connecting the atrium with the peristyle (<a href="#fig115">Figs. 115</a>, <a href="#fig121">121</a>).
The name was used originally to designate an apartment in the
Greek house, but was applied by the Romans to a corridor. In
modern times the passage has often been erroneously called
fauces.</p>

<p>The andron is lacking only in small houses, or in those in
which a different connection is made between the front and
rear portions by means of a second atrium, or other rooms.</p>

<h4>VI. <span class="smcap">Garden, Peristyle, and Rooms about the Peristyle</span></h4>

<p>A few Pompeian houses, like those of the olden time, are
without a peristyle, having a garden at the rear. In such cases
there is a colonnade at the back of the house, facing the garden;
this is the arrangement in the houses of the Surgeon, of
Sallust, and of Epidius Rufus. In the large house of Pansa
(<a href="#fig179">Fig. 179</a>), we find both a peristyle and a garden, the latter
being at the rear of the peristyle; and in many houses a small
garden was placed wherever available space could be found.</p>

<p>The peristyle is a garden enclosed by a colonnade, or having
a colonnade on two or three sides. When this was higher on
the north side than on the other three, as in the house of the
Silver Wedding, the peristyle was called Rhodian. In the Tufa
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
Period the colonnade was frequently in two stories, on all four
sides or on the front alone. Fragments of columns belonging
to the second story have been found in many houses, but in
only one instance, that of the house of the Centenary, are they
of such a character as to enable us to make an accurate restoration;
here the double series of columns extended only across
the front.</p>

<div class="figcenter p6"><a name="plate07" id="plate07"></a>
<img src="images/plate07.jpg" width="600" height="366" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PLATE VII.&mdash;INTERIOR OF A HOUSE, LOOKING FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE ATRIUM
TOWARD THE REAR</p>
</div>

<p>A separate entrance, <i>posticum</i> (<a href="#fig115">Fig. 115</a>), usually connected
the peristyle with a side street. At the rear there was often a
broad, deep recess, <i>exedra</i>, corresponding with the tablinum.
The location of the other rooms in this part of the house is
determined by so many conditions, and manifests so great a
diversity that it may be spoken of more conveniently in connection
with their use.</p>

<h4>VII. <span class="smcap">Sleeping Rooms</span></h4>

<p>The small, high rooms about the atrium were in the earlier
times used as bedrooms; and such they remained in some
houses, as that of the Faun, down to the destruction of the
city.</p>

<p>The sleeping rooms about the peristyle were much lower, and
the front opened by means of a broad door in its whole, or
almost its whole, width upon the colonnade. These rooms
could frequently be entered also through a small side door
from a dining room, or a narrow recess opening on the peristyle
(<a href="#fig146">Fig. 146</a>, <i>x</i>). The design of the arrangement is obvious. In
summer the inconvenient large door could be left open day and
night, a curtain being stretched across the space; in winter it
would be opened only for airing and cleaning, the small door
being used at other times.</p>

<p>The place for the bed was sometimes indicated in the plan
of the room. In a bedroom of the house of the Centaur, of
which an end view is given in <a href="#fig122">Fig. 122</a>, a narrow alcove was
made for the bed at the left side; the floor of the alcove is
slightly raised, and the ceiling, as often, is in the form of a
vault, while the ceiling of the room is higher and only slightly
arched. A similar arrangement is found in several other rooms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
decorated in the first style. In several houses, as in the house
of Apollo, there is a sleeping room with alcoves for two beds.</p>

<p>In bedrooms with a mosaic floor the place for the bed is
ordinarily white, being separated from the rest of the room by
a stripe suggestive of a threshold. A similar division is often
indicated in the wall decoration, particularly that of the second
style; the part designated for the bed is set off by pilasters on
the end walls, and differently treated both in respect to the
decorative design and in the arrangement of colors.</p>

<h4>VIII. <span class="smcap">Dining Rooms</span></h4>

<p>As long as it was customary to sit at meals any fair-sized
apartment could be used as a dining room. When the early
Italic house was extended by the addition of a peristyle, and the
Greek custom of reclining at table was introduced, it became
necessary to provide a special apartment, and the Greek name
for such a room with the three couches, <i>triclinium</i>, came into
use. For convenience in serving, the length of a dining room,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
according to Vitruvius, should be twice the width. At Pompeii,
however, the dimensions are less generous; with an average
width of 12 or 13 feet the length rarely exceeds 20
feet. In many cases one end of the room opened on the
peristyle, but could be closed by means of broad doors or
shutters.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 171px;"><a name="fig123" id="fig123"></a>
<img src="images/fig123.jpg" width="171" height="138" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 123.&mdash;Plan of a dining
room with three couches.<br />
<a href="images/fig123fs.jpg">View larger image</a></p>

<ul class="cap-list">
<li>A. Upper couch, <i>lectus summus</i>.</li>
<li>B. Middle couch, <i>lectus medius</i>.</li>
<li>C. Lower couch, <i>lectus imus</i>.</li>
<li>D. Table, <i>mensa</i>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The plan of a typical dining room is given in <a href="#fig123">Fig. 123</a>. The
couch at the right of the table was called the upper couch; that
at the left, the lower; and that between,
the middle couch. With few exceptions
each couch was made to accommodate
three persons; the diner rested on his
left arm on a cushion at the side nearer
the table, and stretched his feet out toward
the right. Hence, the first on the upper
couch had what was called 'the highest
place.' The one next was said to recline
'below' him, because lying on the side
toward which the first person extended his
feet; the man at the outer end of the lower
couch was said to be 'at the foot,' <i>imus</i>. When in the Gospel
of John we read of a disciple "lying on Jesus' breast," the meaning
is easily explained by reference to Roman usage; John was
reclining in the place next below the Master. This arrangement
makes clear to us the reason why the couches were so
placed that the lower one projected further beyond the table
than the upper one; the feet of those on the lower couch were
extended toward the end furthest from the table.</p>

<p>To the couches grouped in the manner indicated the same
name was applied as to the dining room, triclinium. Of those
in the dining rooms only scanty remains are found. In summer
the Pompeians, as the Italians of to-day, were fond of dining in
the open air. In order to save the trouble of moving heavy
furniture couches of masonry were not infrequently constructed
in the garden, and have been preserved; such a triclinium is
that in the garden of the tannery (<a href="#Page_398">p. 398</a>). The arrangement
is in most cases precisely that indicated in <a href="#fig123">Fig. 123</a>, the outer
end of the lower couch projecting beyond the corresponding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
end of the upper one. In the middle stands the base of the
table, also of masonry; the top is rarely preserved. Near by is
a little altar for the offerings made in connection with each
meal. The appearance of such a triclinium may be inferred
from that of the triclinium funebre shown in <a href="#fig245">Fig. 245</a>, which
has a square table and round altar.</p>

<ul class="cap-list">
<li>A. Room for the table and couches.</li>
<li>B. Anteroom with altar.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>In many gardens we find about the triclinium the remains of
four or six columns. These supported a frame of timber or
lattice-work, upon which vines were trained,
making a shady bower, as in the garden of
the tavern in the first Region, referred to
below (<a href="#Page_404">p. 404</a>).</p>

<p>The couches were ordinarily not provided
with backs, but the outer ends of the upper
and lower couches sometimes had a frame
to hold the cushions, as indicated in <a href="#fig123">Fig. 123</a>
and shown more clearly in our restoration,
<a href="#fig188">Fig. 188</a>. In the dining rooms small movable
altars must have been used for the offerings,
such as those of terra cotta or bronze not infrequently met
with in the course of excavation. A fixed altar has been found
in only one instance, in a small dining room in the eighth Region
(VIII. v-vi. 16). Here, as our plan (<a href="#fig124">Fig. 124</a>) shows, the front
of the apartment is set off as an anteroom, and in this was placed
an altar of tufa.</p>

<p>In accordance with an ancient custom the children, even those
of the imperial family, sat on low stools at a table of their own
on the open side of the large table. In an open-air triclinium in
the ninth Region (IX. v. 11) the children's seat is preserved, a
low bench of masonry about forty inches long connected with the
projecting arm of the lower couch (<a href="#plate07">Plate VII</a>.).</p>

<p>The inner part of the dining room, designed for the table and
couches, was often distinguished from the free space in the
same way that the place for the bed was indicated in bedrooms,
sometimes by a difference in the design of the mosaic floor, more
frequently by the division of the wall decoration and the arrangement
of the ceiling. In the third and fourth decorative styles
the division is less plainly marked than in the second; but often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
the side walls back of the couches and the inner end of the
room have each a single large panel with a small panel at the
right and left, while on each side wall in front are only two
panels, of the same size.</p>

<p>In one respect the ordinary dining room was far from convenient;
those who had the inner places could not leave the
table or return to it in the course of a meal without disturbing
one or more of those reclining nearer the outside. Large rooms,
in which an open space was left between the couches and the
wall, or in which several tables with their sets of couches
could be placed, were unknown in pre-Roman Pompeii. In
the time of the Empire a few of these large dining rooms
were built in older houses. There is one measuring about
25 by 33 feet in the house of Pansa; another, of which the
dimensions are 23 by 30 feet, in the house of Castor and Pollux;
and a third, 36 feet long, in the house of the Citharist.</p>

<p>In a number of houses we find a large, fine apartment&mdash;designated
by the Greek word <i>oecus</i>&mdash;which seems often to
have been used for a dining room, especially on notable occasions.
A particularly elegant form was the Corinthian oecus,
which had a row of columns about the sides a short distance
from the walls, the room being thus divided into a main part
with a vaulted ceiling and a corridor with a flat ceiling. The
couches would be placed in the main part; the guests could
pass to their places along the corridor, behind the columns.
The remains of such an oecus may be seen in the houses of
Meleager and of the Labyrinth.</p>

<p>A specially interesting example&mdash;unfortunately not yet wholly
excavated&mdash;is in the house of the Silver Wedding. In this
case only the inner part, designed for the couches, is set off
by columns. We may assume that there was a vaulted ceiling
over the middle, resting on the entablature of the columns; that
the ceiling of the corridor between the columns and the wall
was flat, and of the same height as the entablature; and that
the front part of the room had a flat or slightly arched ceiling
of the same height as the crown of the vault over the middle.</p>

<p>In the more pretentious Roman houses there was sometimes
a dining room for each season of the year; when Trimalchio in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
Petronius's novel boasts that he has four dining rooms, we are
to understand that he had one each for winter, summer, autumn,
and spring. In the case of the Pompeian houses we are warranted
in assuming that dining rooms opening toward the south
were for winter use, those toward the north for use in summer.
Other airy apartments, with a large window in addition to the
wide door, may well have been intended for summer triclinia.
Further than this it is hardly possible to classify Pompeian dining
rooms according to the seasons.</p>

<h4>IX. <span class="smcap">The Kitchen, the Bath, and the Storerooms</span></h4>

<p>In the Pompeian house the kitchen had no fixed location. It
was generally a small room, and was placed wherever it would
least interfere with the arrangement of the rest of the house.</p>

<p>The most important part of the kitchen was the hearth. This
was built of masonry, against one of the walls. It was oblong,
and the fire was made on the top. The cooking utensils sometimes
rested on rectangular projections of masonry, as in the
kitchen of the house of Pansa, sometimes on small iron tripods,
as in the house of the Vettii (<a href="#fig125">Fig. 125</a>). The hearth of the latter
house was found undisturbed, with a vessel in place ready to
be heated. In one house the place of an iron tripod was taken
by three pointed ends of amphorae set upright on the hearth.
Underneath there was often a hollow place, like that shown in
our illustration, in which fuel was kept, as in similar openings
under the hearths of Campanian kitchens to-day.</p>

<p>Sometimes we find near the hearth a bake oven, not large
enough to have been used for bread, and evidently intended for
pastry; bread must ordinarily have been obtained from the
bakers. In one of the cellars of the house of the Centenary
there is a larger oven, which may have been used to bake coarse
bread for the slaves; the heat was utilized in warming a bath
above.</p>

<p>Over the hearth was a small window to carry off the smoke.
As the kitchen was ordinarily high there may have been a hole
in the roof also, but the upper parts have been destroyed, and
their arrangement cannot be determined. From the small size
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
of the kitchens and of the hearths in even the largest and finest
houses, we may infer that the luxury of the table prevalent in the
Early Empire had made only slight progress at Pompeii.</p>

<p>Close by the kitchen, frequently forming a part of it and next
to the hearth, was the closet; a separate closet of good size is
found in the houses of the Faun and of Castor and Pollux.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig125" id="fig125"></a>
<img src="images/fig125.jpg" width="534" height="299" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 125.&mdash;Hearth of the kitchen in the house of the Vettii.
The arched place underneath is for the storage of fuel.</p>
</div>

<p>In many large houses there is a bath, generally too small to
have been used by more than one person at a time. These
baths ordinarily include only a tepidarium and a caldarium, but
occasionally there is an apodyterium, less frequently still a small
frigidarium; in most cases a basin in the apodyterium or tepidarium
must have been used for the cold bath. The heating arrangements
are similar to those found in the public baths, and
more or less complete according to the period in which the bath
was fitted up, and the taste of the proprietor; a progressive refinement
in the appointments of the private baths can be traced similar
to that which we have already noted in the case of the Stabian
Baths. The close relation generally existing between the bath-rooms
and the kitchen is well illustrated in the houses of the
Faun and of the Silver Wedding.</p>

<p>In connection with this group of rooms we may mention the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
storerooms, which are found in various parts of the houses and
may be identified by the traces of the shelves that were fastened
to the walls.</p>

<p>Comparatively few houses were provided with cellars. In the
house of the Centenary, however, there are two. One, entered
from the atrium by a stairway, extends under the tablinum and
the front colonnade of the peristyle; the other is accessible from
a side atrium and is divided into several rooms, in one of which
is the oven mentioned above. The cellar belonging to the house
of Caecilius Jucundus is under the garden; that of the villa of
Diomedes will be described later.</p>

<h4>X. <span class="smcap">The Shrine of the Household Gods</span></h4>

<p>In ancient Italy each household worshipped its guardian
spirits and tutelary divinities, which formed a triple group, the
Lares, the Penates, and the Genius. In Pompeii the remains
associated with domestic worship are numerous and important.</p>

<p>Many Pompeians painted representations of the household
gods upon an inner wall, often upon a wall of the kitchen, near
the hearth. There was usually a painted altar underneath, with
a serpent on either side coming to partake of the offerings.</p>

<p>In a large number of houses a small niche was made in the
wall, in which were placed little images of the gods, the Lares
and the Genius being also painted on the back of the cavity or
on the wall at the sides or below. Such a niche may be seen
in a corner of the kitchen in the house of Apollo (<a href="#fig126">Fig. 126</a>); the
pictures of the gods are almost obliterated, but that of the serpent&mdash;in
this case there is but one&mdash;and of the altar can be
clearly seen. In front is a small altar of masonry; the ferns
and grasses with which the floor is carpeted make this kitchen
in summer an attractive nook. Sometimes the niches were
ornamented with diminutive half-columns or pilasters at the
sides and a pediment above.</p>

<p>Frequently a more elaborate shrine was provided, a diminutive
temple raised on a foundation, placed against a wall of the atrium
or of the garden. An example is the one at the rear of the peristyle
in the house of the Tragic Poet (<a href="#fig153">Fig. 153</a>).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span></p>

<p>In rare instances a small, separate chapel was devoted to the
domestic worship, as in the house of the Centenary. In a house
of the ninth Region (IX. viii. 7) there is such a chapel in the
garden, a niche for the images being placed in the wall.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><a name="fig126" id="fig126"></a>
<img src="images/fig126.jpg" width="342" height="515" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 126.&mdash;Niche for the images of the household gods,
in a corner of the kitchen in the house of Apollo.<br />

Underneath, a painted serpent represented as about to
take offerings from a round altar. In front is a
square altar for the domestic worship.</p>
</div>

<p>The Lares are the guardian spirits of the household. Originally
but one was
worshipped in each
house; they began to
be honored in plurality
after the time of
Cicero, and at Pompeii
we invariably find
them in pairs. They
are represented as
youths clad in a short
tunic confined by a
girdle (<a href="#fig127">Fig. 127</a>),
stepping lightly or
dancing, with one
hand high uplifted in
which a drinking
horn, <i>rhyton</i>, is seen;
from the end of the
horn a jet of wine
spurts in a graceful
curve, falling into a
small pail, <i>situla</i>, or
into a libation saucer,
<i>patera</i>, held in the
other hand.</p>

<p>Simple offerings
were made to these
beneficent spirits,&mdash;fruits,
sacrificial cakes, garlands, and incense,&mdash;and at every
meal a portion was set aside for them in little dishes. When a
sacrifice was offered to the Lares, the victim was a pig.</p>

<p>With the worship of the Lares was associated that of the
Genius, the tutelary divinity of the master of the house. He is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
represented as a standing figure, the face being a portrait of the
master. The toga is drawn over his head, after the manner of
one sacrificing; in the left hand there is usually a cornucopia,
sometimes a box of incense, <i>acerra</i>; with the right hand he pours
a drink offering from a patera.</p>

<p>Very rarely we find a representation of the Genius of the mistress
of the house. In one painting she appears with the
attributes of Juno; the Genius of a woman was often called
Juno, as in the inscription on the bust stone of Tyche, the slave
of Julia Augusta (<a href="#Page_418">p. 418</a>). As a man might swear in the name
of his Genius, so a woman's oath might be 'By my Juno.'</p>

<p>The Lares and the Genius are often found together both in
the hearth paintings, and in the groups of little bronze images
frequently placed in the shrines. They are associated also in
an inscription on the shrine in the house of Epidius Rufus: <i>Genio
M[arci] n[ostri] et Laribus duo Diadumeni liberti</i>,&mdash;'To the
Genius of our Marcus and the Lares; (dedicated by) his two
freedmen with the name of Diadumenus.' Marcus was the first
name of the head of the household.</p>

<p>In a few cases the Genius of the emperor seems to have been
revered at a house shrine. Horace (Od. IV. v. 34) speaks distinctly
of the worship of the tutelary divinity of Augustus in
connection with that of the Lares,&mdash;<i>et Laribus tuum Miscet
numen</i>. On the rear wall of a little chapel in a garden is a
painted altar at the right of which stands Jupiter, at the left a
Genius, each pouring a libation. We can scarcely believe that
the Genius of an ordinary man would thus be placed as it were
on an equality with the ruler of heaven; more likely the Genius
of an emperor is represented, perhaps that of Claudius. The
face is not unlike the face of Claudius, and the painting is on a
wall decorated in the third style (Ins. VII. xi. 4).</p>

<p>In another house (IX. viii. 13) two Genii are painted, and
under one of them is scratched in large letters <i>EX SC</i>, undoubtedly
for <i>ex senatus consulto</i>,&mdash;'in accordance with a decree
of the Senate.' We are probably safe in assuming that the
decree referred to is that of the reign of Augustus, by which the
worship of the Lares was regulated (Dio Cass. LI. xix. 7); if so,
the figure is intended to represent the Genius of that emperor.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span></p>

<p>The face of the Genius in the house of the Vettii (<a href="#fig127">Fig. 127</a>)
bears a decided resemblance to that of Nero. Here the shrine
was placed in the rear wall of the smaller atrium. It consists
of a broad, shallow niche, the front of which is elaborately
ornamented to give the appearance of a little temple, while on
the back are painted the household divinities. The Genius
stands with veiled head between the two Lares, holding in his
left hand a box of incense and pouring a libation with the right.
In the original painting the features were unusually distinct.</p>

<p>The Penates were the protecting divinities of the provisions
or stores, <i>penus</i>, and the storerooms of the house; under this
name were included various gods to whom the master and the
household offered special worship. At Pompeii the Penates, as
the Lares and the Genius, appear in paintings, and are also represented
by bronze images placed in the shrines. In the shrine
of the house of Lucretius were diminutive bronze figures of the
Genius and of Jupiter, Hercules, Fortuna, and another divinity
that has not been identified. Statuettes of Apollo, Aesculapius,
Hercules, and Mercury were found, together with those of the
two Lares, in another house; in a third, Fortuna alone with the
Lares.</p>

<p>Jupiter and Fortuna are frequently met with in shrine paintings,
as well as Venus Pompeiana (<a href="#fig004">Fig. 4</a>), Hercules, Mars, and
Vulcan as a personification of the hearth fire; Vesta, the patron
goddess of bakers, usually appears in the hearth paintings of
bake shops.</p>

<p>Underneath the representations of the Lares and Penates
ordinarily are painted two serpents, one on either side of an
altar, which they are approaching in order to partake of the
offerings; these consist of fruits, in the midst of which an egg
or a pine cone can usually be distinguished. As early as the
beginning of the Empire the significance of the serpent in the
Roman worship had ceased to be clearly understood; Virgil
represents Aeneas as in doubt whether the serpent which came
out from the tomb of Anchises was the attendant of his father
or the Genius of the place (Aen. V. 95).</p>

<p>In the Pompeian paintings, when a pair of serpents occurs,
one may usually be recognized as a male by the prominent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
crest. They were undoubtedly looked upon as personifications
of the Genii of the master and mistress of the house. When
a single crested serpent appears, as in the shrine paintings of
both the house of the Vettii (<a href="#fig127">Fig. 127</a>) and the house of Apollo
(<a href="#fig126">Fig. 126</a>), we are to understand that the head of the household
was unmarried.</p>

<h4>XI. <span class="smcap">Second Story Rooms</span></h4>
<p>With few exceptions the houses of pre-Roman Pompeii were
built in only one story; where the peristyle was in two stories,
there must have been rooms opening upon the upper colonnade.
In Roman times, as the population of the city increased and
more space was needed, it became a common practice to make
the rooms about the atrium lower and build chambers over
them. A complete second story was rare; small rooms were
added here and there, frequently at different levels and reached
by different stairways. Sometimes the second story on the
front side projected a few feet over the street; an example may
be seen in a house in the seventh Region (casa del Balcone
Pensile), the front of which, with the part projecting over the
sidewalk, has been carefully rebuilt by replacing the charred
remains of the ancient beams with new timbers.</p>

<p>Houses with three stories were quite exceptional, and the
rooms of the third floor must have been unimportant. Along
the steep slope of the hill, on the west and southwest sides of
the city, a number of houses are found that present the appearance
of several stories; they are not properly classed with those
just mentioned, however, for the reason that the floors are on
terraces, the highest at the level of the street, the others lower
down and further back, being adjusted to the descent of the
ground.</p>

<p>From the time of Plautus, second story rooms were designated
as 'dining rooms,' <i>cenacula</i>. Varro says that after it
became customary to dine upstairs, all upper rooms were called
cenacula. This explanation is not altogether satisfactory, because
other literary evidence for the prevalence of such a
custom is lacking. Perhaps in early times, when, on account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
of the introduction of the compluvium and impluvium, the
atrium ceased to be convenient and comfortable for the serving
of meals, a dining room was frequently constructed on an upper
floor, and, being the principal second story apartment, gave its
name to the rest. In some places the ancient custom may still
have lingered in the time of the Early Empire.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig128" id="fig128"></a>
<img src="images/fig128.jpg" width="539" height="457" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 128.&mdash;Interior of a house with a second story dining room opening on the atrium,
restored.</p>
</div>

<p>The upper parts of the Pompeian houses in most cases have
been completely destroyed; in a few, however, there are traces
of a second story apartment that was probably used as a dining
room.</p>

<p>One of these houses is in Insula XV of Region VII, near the
temple of Apollo. It is painted in the second style, and dates
apparently from the end of the Republic. At the rear of the
atrium are two rooms and a passageway leading to the back of
the house. Over these was a single large apartment, closed at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
the sides and rear, but opening on the atrium in its entire
length; along the front, as seen in our restoration (<a href="#fig128">Fig. 128</a>),
ran a balustrade connecting the pilasters&mdash;ornamented with
half-columns&mdash;which supported the roof.</p>

<p>In a corner of the atrium at the rear a narrow stairway led
to the second floor. At the right, as our section shows
(<a href="#fig129">Fig. 129</a>), was a narrow gallery resting on brackets, which connected
the upper room at the rear with one in the front of the house.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig129" id="fig129"></a>
<img src="images/fig129.jpg" width="600" height="279" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 129.&mdash;Longitudinal section of the house with a second story dining room.<br />
At the right, vestibule, door, and fauces, with front room above; then the atrium, with the
gallery connecting the front room with the dining room; lastly, the apartments at the
rear of the house. In this house there was no peristyle.</p>
</div>

<p>The large upper room was so well fitted for a dining room,
especially in summer, that we can hardly resist the conclusion
that it was designed for this purpose. There is no trace of a
kitchen on the ground floor; and for greater convenience this
also was probably placed in the second story, behind the dining
room.</p>

<p>In the fifth Region there was a small dwelling, which afterwards
became a part of the house of the Silver Wedding; the
arrangement of the two stories at the rear of the atrium was
similar to that just described, except that columns were used
in place of the pilasters, and there was only the one upper
room in the back part of the house. In such cases as this 'dining
room' and 'upper story' might easily have come to be used
as synonymous terms.</p>

<p>Where there was a large upper room at the rear of the
atrium, no place was left for the high tablinum; in a house in
the seventh Region (casa dell' Amore Punito, VII. ii. 23) the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
cenaculum was in front. On the front wall of the atrium one
may still see part of the carefully hewn stones on which the
columns of the second story rested, and fragments of these
columns were found on the floor below.</p>

<h4>XII. <span class="smcap">The Shops</span></h4>

<p>The outer parts of the houses fronting on the principal thoroughfares
were utilized as shops. On the more retired side
streets there were fewer shops, and we often find a façade of
masonry unbroken except for the front door and an occasional
window.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;"><a name="fig130" id="fig130"></a>
<img src="images/fig130.jpg" width="241" height="229" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 130.&mdash;Plan of a Pompeian shop.<br />

<ul class="cap-list">
<li>1. Entrance.</li>
<li>2. Counter.</li>
<li>3. Place for a fire.</li>
<li>4. Stairway to upper floor.</li>
<li>5, 5. Back rooms.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The shop fronts were open to the street. The counter, frequently
of masonry, has in most cases the shape indicated on
our plan (<a href="#fig130">Fig. 130</a>, 2), being so arranged that customers could
make their purchases, if they wished, without going inside the
shop. Large jars were often set
in it, to serve as receptacles for
the wares and edibles exposed for
sale. Sometimes on the end next
to the wall there are little steps,
on which, as seen in our restoration
(<a href="#fig131">Fig. 131</a>), measuring cups
and other small vessels were
placed. At the inner end we
see now and then a depression
(3) over which a vessel could be
heated, a fire being kindled underneath
as on a hearth. In the
wineshops a separate hearth is
sometimes found, and occasionally a leaden vessel for heating
water.</p>

<p>In the houses of the Tufa Period the shops, as the front
doors and the rooms about the atrium, were relatively high.
Those of the house of Caecilius Jucundus measured nearly 16
feet; those of the house of the Faun, 19 feet; the appearance
of the latter may be suggested by our restoration (<a href="#fig139">Fig. 139</a>).
The height was divided by an upper floor, <i>pergula</i>, 10 or 12 feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
above the ground, along the open front of which was a balustrade;
the stairs leading to it were inside the shop. On such
a pergula Apelles, according to Pliny (N. H. xxxv. 84), was
accustomed to display his paintings; and in the Digest reference
is more than once made to cases in which a person passing
along the street was injured by an object falling upon him from
the second story of a shop. 'Shops with their upper floors'
are advertised for rent in one of the painted inscriptions found
at Pompeii (<a href="#Page_489">p. 489</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig131" id="fig131"></a>
<img src="images/fig131.jpg" width="406" height="424" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 131.&mdash;A shop for the sale of edibles, restored.</p>
</div>

<p>In Roman times the shops, as the inner rooms of the house,
were built lower, and over them small closed rooms were made,
which were called by the same name as the open floor, pergula.
These rooms were frequently accessible from the street by a
stairway, and in such cases could be rented separately. In
colloquial language, a man whose early life had been passed
amid unfavorable surroundings was said to have been 'born in
a room over a shop,'&mdash;<i>natus in pergula</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span></p>

<p>Shops were entered by means of small doors; the front was
closed with shutters. These consisted of overlapping boards
set upright in narrow grooves at the top and the bottom. A
separate set of shutters was provided for the open pergula.</p>

<h4>XIII. <span class="smcap">Walls, Floors, and Windows</span></h4>

<p>The walls were covered with a thick layer of plaster and
painted; the preparation of the stucco, the processes employed
in painting, and the styles of decoration are reserved for discussion
in a later chapter.</p>

<p>The floors were frequently made of an inexpensive concrete,
consisting of bits of lava or other stone pounded down into
common mortar. A much better floor was the Signia pavement,
<i>opus Signinum</i>, so named from a town in Latium. This
was composed of very small fragments of brick or tile pounded
into fine mortar. The surface was carefully finished, and was
sometimes ornamented with geometrical or other patterns traced
in outline by means of small bits of white stone.</p>

<p>In the Tufa Period a floor was often made by fitting together
small pieces of stone or marble, and bedding them well in mortar.
The colors are white and black,&mdash;slate is used in the floor
of the atrium in the house of the Faun; sometimes also violet,
yellow, green, and red appear with white and black. Pavements
of square or lozenge-shaped and triangular pieces of
colored marble and slate, like that in the cella of the temple
of Apollo (<a href="#fig028">Fig. 28</a>), are occasionally found in houses. In the
time of the Early Empire floors paved with larger slabs were
not uncommon.</p>

<p>The mosaics of the Pompeian floors&mdash;using the term mosaic
in a restricted sense&mdash;may be divided into two classes, coarse
and fine. In the former the cubes, <i>tesserae</i>, are on the average
a little less than half an inch square. The patterns are sometimes
shown in black on a white surface, sometimes worked in
colors. The finer variety, in which the pictures appear, is not
often extended over a whole room, but is usually confined to a
rectangular section in the middle, coarse mosaic being used for
the rest of the floor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span></p>

<p>The windows at the front of the house, as we have seen, were
ordinarily few and small. From the Tufa Period, however,
large windows were often made in the rooms around the peristyle;
in the house of the Faun they range in width from 10 to
23 feet, and are so low that one sitting inside could look out
through them. Upper rooms, also, were provided with windows
of good size, sometimes measuring 2½ by 4 feet; but the remains
are scanty. In later times occasionally a lower window
opening on the street was made almost as large, and was protected
by an iron grating.</p>

<p>Windows were ordinarily closed by means of wooden shutters.
Small panes of glass were found in the openings of the
Baths near the Forum; had the Central Baths been finished,
glass would undoubtedly have been used for the windows of
the caldarium. The window of the tepidarium in the villa of
Diomedes was closed by four glass panes set in a wooden frame
(<a href="#Page_357">p. 357</a>); in the other houses a narrow pane is occasionally found,
but invariably set in masonry.

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE HOUSE OF THE SURGEON</i></span></h3>

<p>The house of the Surgeon (casa del Chirurgo) is the oldest
of the Pompeian houses that retained to the last, with but slight
modifications, its original plan and appearance. It lies at the
right of the Strada Consolare
(VI. i. 10), about fifty paces
inside the Herculaneum Gate.
The name was suggested by
the discovery of several surgical
instruments in one of the
rooms.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 270px;"><a name="fig132" id="fig132"></a>

<li>20. Garden.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>This house was undoubtedly
built before 200 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> The façade
(<a href="#fig010">Fig. 10</a>) and the walls of
the atrium are of large hewn
blocks of Sarno limestone;
other inner walls are of limestone
framework (<a href="#Page_37">p. 37</a>). The
plan conforms to the simple
Italic type, before the addition
of the peristyle; yet it does not
illustrate the oldest form of the
native house, for the tablinum
(<a href="#fig132">Fig. 132</a>, 7) has already displaced
the recess for the bed
opposite the front door. The
measurements of the rooms are according to the Oscan standard
(<a href="#Page_44">p. 44</a>), the atrium being about 30 by 35 Oscan feet.</p>

<p>We pass directly from the street through the fauces (1) into
the Tuscan atrium (5) at the sides of which are sleeping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
rooms (6) and the two alae (8). Back of the tablinum is a
colonnade (16) opening on the garden (20), which originally
had a greater length; the room at the right (19) is a later
addition, as also the smaller room at the other end (21). The
roof of the colonnade was carried by square limestone pillars,
one of which has been preserved in its original form.</p>

<p>The oblong room at the right of the tablinum (10) was once
square, as (9). Both were well adapted for winter dining rooms;
in summer, meals were undoubtedly served in the tablinum.
The room at the left of the entrance (2) was a shop, at least
in later times. The corresponding room on the other side
(6') was retained for domestic use.</p>

<p>The shop at the right (3) and the back room (4), as well as
the kitchen with the adjoining rooms at the rear, used as store
closets and quarters for slaves, were a later addition; 22 is a
light court, to which the rain water was conducted from different
parts of the roof. Over these rooms was a second story
reached by stairs leading from the colonnade (18). It may be
that this part of the house took the place of a garden in which
previously there was an outside kitchen; that the ground belonged
to the house from the beginning is clear from the existence
of a door between the rooms 6' and 3, afterwards walled
up, and the appearance of the unbroken party wall on this
side.</p>

<p>The rooms about the atrium had no upper floor, and were
relatively high; the doors measured nearly twelve feet in height,
and the ceiling of the tablinum was not far from twenty feet above
the floor. In respect to height, this house was not unlike those
of the next period.</p>

<p>In the later years of the city, but before 63, the decoration
was renewed in the fourth style. There are paintings of interest,
however, only in the room at the rear (19), which had a
large window opening on the garden. In one of the panels
here we see a man sitting with a writing tablet in his hand;
opposite him are two girls, one sitting, the other standing; the
latter holds a roll of papyrus. This kind of genre picture is not
uncommon; the type is spoken of elsewhere (<a href="#Page_477">p. 477</a>).</p>

<p>In another panel, which was transferred to the Naples
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
Museum, a young woman is represented as painting a herm
of Dionysus (<a href="#fig133">Fig. 133</a>); a Cupid is holding the unfinished picture
while she mixes colors on her palette. Two other maidens
are watching the artist with unfeigned interest. Upon the
pillar behind the herm hangs a small painting; in the vista
another herm is seen, together with a vase standing on a pillar.</p>

<p>The room contained a third picture which is now almost
obliterated. Perhaps this pleasant apartment was once the
boudoir of a favorite daughter, who busied herself with painting
and verse.

<h3>CHAPTER XXXV<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE HOUSE OF SALLUST</i></span></h3>

<p>The house of Sallust (VI. ii. 4) received its name from an
election notice, painted on the outside, in which Gaius Sallustius
was recommended for a municipal office. It has no peristyle,
and its original plan closely resembled that of the house of the
Surgeon. It was built in the second century <span class="s08">B.C.</span>; the architecture
is that of the Tufa Period, and the well preserved decoration
of the atrium, tablinum, alae, and the dining room at the
left of the tablinum (<a href="#fig134">Fig. 134</a>, 22) is of the first style. The
pilasters at the entrances of the alae and the tablinum are also
unusually well preserved; the house is among the most important
for our knowledge of the period to which it belongs.</p>

<p>The rooms on the left side (6-9) were used as a bakery.
Those in front (2-5) were shops; two of them (2, 3), at the
time of the destruction of the city, opened into the fauces (1)
and another (5) had two rear rooms, one of which was entered
from a side street.</p>

<p>The rooms at the right (31-36) were private apartments
added later and connected with the rest of the house only by
means of the corridor (29), which with the cell designed for the
porter (30) was made over from one of the side rooms of the
atrium.</p>

<p>If we leave these groups of rooms out of consideration, it is
easy to see that the Tuscan atrium and the apartments connected
with it&mdash;the tablinum (19), the alae (17), and the rooms
at the sides&mdash;once formed a symmetrical whole. At the rear
was a garden on two sides (24, 24'), with a colonnade. A
broad window in the rear of the left ala opened into this colonnade
(<a href="#Page_259">p. 259</a>), a part of which was afterwards enclosed, making
two small rooms (23, 18). At the end of the latter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
room a stairway was built leading to chambers; in the beginning
the house had no second floor.</p>

</div>

<p>The andron (20), the wardrobe (17') at the side of the right
ala, and the small room back of it (28) were made out of a
square room corresponding in dimensions with that at the other
end of the tablinum (22). The latter was originally entered
from the atrium by a door at <i>e</i>, which was closed when the wide
door was made at the rear opening upon the colonnade. At
the rear of the tablinum is a broad window.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span></p>

<p>In the corner of the garden is an open air triclinium (25),
over which vines could be trained; there was a small altar (<i>l</i>)
near by. At <i>n</i> a jet of water spurted from an opening in the
wall upon a small platform of masonry; the water was perhaps
conducted into the rectangular basin (<i>k</i>) opposite, the inside of
which was painted blue. Only the edges of this portion of the
garden, which is higher than the floor of the colonnade, were
planted; steps led up to it at <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>. A hearth (<i>p</i>) was placed
in the colonnade at the left, for the preparation of the viands
served in the triclinium. The room at the other end of the
garden (27) was connected with the street at the rear by a
posticum; back of it was an open space (26) with remains of
masonry (<i>m</i>), the purpose of which is not clear.</p>

<p>The large dining room (13) may once have belonged to the
bakery; the anteroom (12) leading to it was made from one of
the side rooms of the atrium. The arrangement recalls that of
the dining room of which the plan is given in <a href="#fig124">Fig. 124</a>.</p>

<p>The appearance of the atrium in its original form may be
suggested by our restoration (<a href="#fig135">Fig. 135</a>). The proportions are
monumental. The treatment of the entrances to the tablinum
and the alae, with pilasters joined by projecting entablatures,
the severe and simple decoration (illustrated in <a href="#fig261">Fig. 261</a>), and
the admission of light through the compluvium increased the
apparent height of the room and gave it an aspect of dignity
and reserve. At the rear we catch glimpses of the vines and
shrubs at the edge of the garden; painted trees and bushes were
also seen upon the garden wall.</p>

<p>The series of apartments entered through the room at the
right of the atrium (29) present a marked contrast with the rest
of the house. They are low, the eight-sided, dark-red columns
of the colonnade (31), with their white capitals, being less than
ten feet high; and the dark shades of the decoration, which is in
the fourth style upon a black ground, give a gloomy impression
to one coming from the atrium with its masses of brilliant color.</p>

<p>There was a small fountain in the middle of the little garden
(32), the rear wall of which is covered by a painting representing
the fate of Actaeon, torn to pieces by his own hounds as a
penalty for having seen Diana at the bath. At first the colonnade

had a flat roof, with an open walk above on the three
sides; but when the large dining room (35) was constructed,
the flat roof and promenade on this side were replaced by a
sloping roof over the broad entrance to the dining room. On
the outer walls of the two sleeping rooms (33, 34) were two
paintings of similar design, Europa with the bull, Phrixus and
Helle with the ram. The rear inner wall of 34 contained two
pairs of lovers, Paris and Helen in the house of Menelaus, and
Ares and Aphrodite. The room at the corner of the colonnade
(36) is the kitchen; the stairway in it led to the flat roof of the
colonnade.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 135.&mdash;Atrium of the house of Sallust, looking through the tablinum and colonnade
at the rear into the garden, restored.</p>
</div>

<p>This portion of the house probably dates from the latter part
of the Republic; it underwent minor changes in the course of
the century during which it was used. Previously there was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
all probability a garden on this side, into which opened a large
window in the rear wall of the right ala, afterwards closed.</p>

<p>The changes made in the stately house of the pre-Roman
time are most easily explained on the supposition that near the
beginning of the Empire it was turned into a hotel and restaurant.
The shop at the left of the entrance (3) opens upon the
atrium as well as on the street; the principal counter is on the
side of the fauces, and near the inner end is a place for heating
a vessel over the fire. Large jars were set in the counter, and
there was a stone table in the middle of the room. Here edibles
and hot drinks were sold to those inside the house as well
as to passers-by. The shop at the right of the entrance was
connected with the fauces, the atrium, and a side room (16).
The number of sleeping rooms had been increased by changes
in several of the earlier apartments, and by the addition of a
second floor reached by the stairway in room 18. The private
apartments were for the use of the proprietor, and were guarded
against the intrusion of the guests of the inn by the porter
stationed at the entrance (in 30).</p>

triclinium in the corner of the garden.</p>
</div>

<p>This explanation is confirmed by the close connection of the
bakery with the house; and the use of the open-air triclinium
is entirely consistent with it (<a href="#Page_404">p. 404</a>). The arrangement of
the house after it had become an inn may be seen in our section
(<a href="#fig136">Fig. 136</a>).

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVI<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE HOUSE OF THE FAUN</i></span></h3>

<p>The house of the Faun, so named from the statue of a
dancing satyr found in it (<a href="#fig258">Fig. 258</a>), was among the largest
and most elegant in Pompeii. It illustrates for us the type of
dwelling that wealthy men of cultivated tastes living in the
third or second century <span class="s08">B.C.</span> built and adorned for themselves.
The mosaic pictures found on the floors (now in the Naples Museum)
are the most beautiful that have survived to modern times.</p>

<p>The wall decoration, which is of the first style, in the more important
rooms was left unaltered to the last, and is well preserved.
This decoration, however, does not date from the building of
the house. In order to protect the painted surfaces against
moisture, the walls in the beginning were carefully covered with
sheets of lead before they were plastered. Later two doorways
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
were walled up, and the plastering over the apertures, which
was applied directly to the wall surface without the use of
lead sheathing, forms with its decoration an inseparable part of
that found on either side. When the original decoration was
replaced by that which we see on the walls to-day it is impossible
to determine, but the change must have been made
before the first century <span class="s08">B.C.</span> A few unimportant rooms are
painted in the second and fourth styles.</p>

<p>An entire block (VI. xii.), measuring approximately 315 by
115 feet, is given to the house; there are no shops except the
four in front (<a href="#fig137">Fig. 137</a>). The apartments are arranged in four
groups: a large Tuscan atrium, B, with living rooms on three
sides; a small tetrastyle atrium, <i>b</i>, with rooms for domestic
service around it and extending
on the right side
toward the rear of the
house; a peristyle, G, the
depth of which equals the
width of the large and half
that of the small atrium;
and a second peristyle, K,
occupying more than a
third of the block. At the rear of the second peristyle is a
series of small rooms (<i>q-u</i>) the depth of which varies according
to the deviation of the street at the north end of the insula.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 138.&mdash;Part of the cornice over the large
front door.<br />
<a href="images/fig138fs.jpg">View larger image</a></p>
</div>

<p>In front of the main entrance we read the word HAVE (more
commonly written <i>ave</i>), 'Welcome!' spelled in the sidewalk
with bits of green, yellow, red, and white marble. The street
door here, quite exceptionally, was at the outer end of the vestibule.
It consisted of three leaves (seen in <a href="#fig139">Fig. 139</a>) and opened
toward the inside, while the double door between the vestibule
and the fauces (A on the plan) opened toward the outside; the
closed vestibule was not unlike those of many modern houses.
Fragments of the lintel over the outer door, with its projecting
dentil cornice, are preserved in one of the shops (<a href="#fig138">Fig. 138</a>).</p>

<p>The shops with their upper floors, <i>pergulae</i>, were nineteen
feet high. When the shutters were up they presented
a monotonous appearance (<a href="#fig139">Fig. 139</a>), but on sunny days, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
the articles offered for sale were attractively displayed, and
buyers and idlers were loitering in front or leisurely passing
from one to the other, shops and street alike were full of color
and animation.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig139" id="fig139"></a>

<a href="images/fig139fs.jpg">View larger image</a></p>
</div>

<p>The floor of the fauces, as of many of the other rooms, is rich
in color. It is made of small triangular pieces of marble and
slate&mdash;red, yellow, green, white, and black. At the inner end
it was marked off from the floor of the atrium by a stripe of
finely executed mosaic, suggestive of a threshold (<a href="#fig140">Fig. 140</a>),
now in the Naples Museum. Two tragic masks are realistically
outlined, appearing in the midst of fruits, flowers, and garlands,
the details of which are worked out with much skill.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig140" id="fig140"></a>
<img src="images/fig140.jpg" width="584" height="128" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 140.&mdash;Border of mosaic with tragic masks, fruits, flowers, and garlands, at the inner
end of the fauces.</p>
</div>

<p>The walls of the fauces are ornamented in an unusual manner.
The ordinary decoration of the first style is carried to the height
of eight feet. Above this on either side projects a tufa shelf
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
about sixteen inches wide, on which is placed the façade of a
diminutive temple; that on the left is seen in <a href="#fig141">Fig. 141</a>. The
front of the cella, with closed doors, is presented in relief, but
the four columns of the portico stand free. The shelf is supported
underneath by a cornice which rested originally on stucco
brackets in the shape of dogs; the underside is carved to represent
a richly ornamented coffered ceiling.</p>

<p>The atrium was a room of imposing dimensions. The length
is approximately 53 feet, the breadth 33; the height, as indicated
by the remains of the walls and the pilasters, was certainly
not less than 28 feet. Above was a coffered ceiling.
The sombre shade of the floor, paved with small pieces of dark
slate, formed an effective contrast with the white limestone
edge and brilliant inner surface of the shallow impluvium, covered
with pieces of colored marbles similar to those in the
fauces. Still more marked was the contrast in the strong colors
of the walls. Below was a broad surface of black; then a projecting
white dentil cornice, and above this, masses of dark red,
bluish green, and yellow. The decoration, as usual in the first
style, was not carried to the ceiling, but stopped just above the
side doors; the upper part of the wall was left in the white.</p>

<p>As one stepped across the mosaic border at the end of the
fauces, a beautiful vista opened up before the eyes. From the
aperture of the compluvium a diffused light was spread through
the atrium brilliant with its rich coloring. At the rear the lofty
entrance of the tablinum attracted the visitor by its stately
dignity. Now the portières are drawn aside, and beyond the
large window of the tablinum the columns of the first peristyle
are seen (<a href="#fig141">Fig. 141</a>). The shrubs and flowers of the garden are
bright with sunshine, and fragrant odors are wafted through the
house; in the midst a slender fountain jet rises in the air and
falls with a murmur pleasant to the ear. If the vegetation was
not too luxuriant, one might look into the exedra, on the further
side of the colonnade, and even catch glimpses of the trees and
bushes in the garden of the second peristyle.</p>

<p>Of the rooms at the side of the atrium, one (<i>f'</i>) was apparently
the family sleeping room; places for two beds were set
off by slight elevations in the floor. This room had been carefully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
redecorated in the second style; the room opposite, the
decoration of which was inferior to that of the rest, was perhaps
used by the porter (<i>atriensis</i>).</p>

<p>The tablinum (D), like that of the house of Sallust, had a
broad window opening on the colonnade of the peristyle. In
the middle of this room is a rectangular section paved with lozenge-shaped
pieces of black, white, and green stone; the rest of
the floor is of white mosaic. The floor of each ala was ornamented
with a mosaic picture. In that at the left (C) are doves
pulling a necklace out of a casket&mdash;a work of slight merit.</p>

<p>The mosaic picture found in the right ala is characterized by
delicacy of execution and harmonious coloring. It is divided
into two parts; above is a cat with a partridge; below, ducks,
fishes, and shellfish. A large window in the rear wall of this
ala opens into the small atrium, not for the admission of light,
but for ventilation; in summer there would be a circulation of
air between the two atriums.</p>

<p>Two doors, at the right and the left of the tablinum (seen in
<a href="#fig143">Fig. 143</a>), opened into large dining rooms, one (E) nearly square,
the other (F) oblong. Both had large windows on the side
of the peristyle, and the one at the left also a door opening
upon the colonnade. The mosaic pictures in the floors harmonized
well with the purpose of the rooms. In one were fishes
of various kinds, and sea monsters; in the other was the picture&mdash;often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
reproduced&mdash;in which the Genius of the autumn is represented
as a vine-crowned boy sitting on a panther and drinking
out of a deep golden bowl.</p>

<p>The colonnade of the first peristyle was of one story
(<a href="#fig141">Fig. 141</a>). The entablature of the well proportioned Ionic columns
presented a mixture of styles often met with in Pompeii, a Doric
frieze with a dentil cornice. The wall surfaces were divided by
pilasters and decorated in the first style. In the middle of the
garden the delicately carved standard of a marble fountain basin
may still be seen.</p>

<p>The open front of the broad exedra (H) was adorned with two
columns, and at the rear was a window extending almost from
side to side, opening upon the second peristyle. Between the
columns of the entrance were mosaic pictures of the creatures
of the Nile,&mdash;hippopotamus, crocodile, ichneumon, and ibis;
and in the room, filling almost the entire floor, was the most
famous of ancient mosaic pictures, the battle between Alexander
and Darius.</p>

<p>This great composition has so often been reproduced that we
need not present it here; as illustrating the style and treatment,
however, we give a small section, in which the face of Alexander
appears (<a href="#fig142">Fig. 142</a>). The mosaic is a reproduction of a painting
made either in the lifetime of Alexander, or soon after his death.
The battle is perhaps that of Issus. The left side of the picture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
is unfortunately only in part preserved. At the head of the
Greek horsemen rides Alexander, fearless, unhelmeted, leading a
charge against the picked guard of Darius. The long spear of
the terrible Macedonian is piercing the side of a Persian noble,
whose horse sinks under him. The driver of Darius's chariot
is putting the lash to the horses, but the fleeing king turns with
an expression of anguish and terror to witness the death of his
courtier, the mounted noblemen about him being panic-stricken
at the resistless onset of the Greeks. The grouping of the combatants,
the characterization of the individual figures, the skill
with which the expressions upon the faces are rendered, and the
delicacy of coloring give this picture a high rank among ancient
works of art. The colors in the mosaic are necessarily more
subdued than in the original painting.</p>

<p>Alexander, having thrown aside his helmet, is leading the charge upon the guard of Darius,
who is already in flight.</p>
</div>

<p>A corridor (<i>p</i>), both ends of which could be closed, led from
the first to the second peristyle. The columns here, of the
Doric order, were of brick, with tufa capitals, the shafts being
edged, not fluted. The entablature rested on a line of timbers, as
often in the buildings of the Tufa Period. In our restoration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
(<a href="#fig141">Fig. 141</a>) an upper colonnade of the Ionic order is assumed,
extending about the four sides. The restoration is here possibly
at fault; the colonnade may have been in two stories only on
the south side, with twice as many columns above as below.</p>

<p>On either side of the exedra were two dining rooms (I, J), one
open in its entire breadth upon the second peristyle, the other
having a narrow door with two windows. The fine mosaic
picture in I was found in so damaged a condition that the subject&mdash;a
lion standing over a prostrate tiger&mdash;could not be made
out, until a duplicate was discovered in 1885.</p>

<p>In the sleeping room on the other side of the corridor (N),
which had been redecorated in the second style, remains of two
beds were found. The room next to it (L) was the largest in
this part of the house; at the time of the eruption it was without
decoration and was used as a wine cellar. A great number
of amphorae were found in it, as also in both peristyles.</p>

<p>One of the small rooms at the rear (<i>q</i>) was perhaps occupied
by the gardener; the one next to it (<i>r</i>) was the doorkeeper's
room. At <i>v</i> is a long, shallow niche, designed for statues.
Nearer the corner were two smaller niches, each of which was
ornamented in front with pilasters and a gable. These were
the shrines of the household gods; in front of them were found
two bronze tripods, two bronze lamp stands, two pairs of iron
tongs, a couple of common lamps, and the remains of a branch
of laurel with the bones and eggs of a dove that had nested in
it. A bronze statuette of a Genius was found seemingly in
one of the niches.</p>

<p>The domestic apartments were entered by a front door
between the two shops at the right (<a href="#fig139">Fig. 139</a>). The vestibule,
unlike that of the other entrance, is open to the street, the
fauces being narrower and deeper. The relation of the tetrastyle
to the Tuscan atrium is indicated in our transverse section
(<a href="#fig143">Fig. 143</a>). The alae (<i>c</i>, <i>c'</i>) are here at the middle of the sides;
the one at the left served as a passageway between the two
atriums. The four tufa Corinthian columns, nearly twenty feet
high, are well preserved, as well as the pilasters at the entrances
of the alae. A tablinum was not needed in this part of the
house, and the space which it might have occupied was given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
to the andron (<i>k</i>) and a sleeping room opening on the first
peristyle (<i>l</i>).</p>

<p>This part of the house was much damaged by the earthquake
of 63, and there are many traces of repairs, particularly in the
upper rooms. The walls were simply painted in the fourth
style. Two money chests stood on large flat stones in the rear
corners of this atrium.</p>

<p>In one of the rooms at the front (<i>e</i>) there are traces of
shelves; stairs at one side led to the upper rooms at the left
of the atrium, the shape and size of which are indicated in
<a href="#fig143">Fig. 143</a>. On the right, also, there were small chambers over
<i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, and <i>h'</i>, on the same level as the second floor of the shop
in front (4), and accessible only by means of the stairway in
this shop; there were no other stairs in this corner of the
house, and these rooms could not have been connected with
chambers over other parts of the atrium, because there were no
upper rooms over the fauces and the right ala (<i>c'</i>). Another
stairway in <i>d</i>, partly of wood, led to chambers over <i>i</i>, <i>d'</i>, <i>n'</i>, <i>n</i>,
<i>o</i>, <i>o'</i>, and part of the kitchen, M.</p>

<p>Bronze vessels and remains of ivory feet belonging to a bedstead
were found in the double room <i>h</i>, <i>h'</i>; but it is more likely
that this was used as a storeroom for discarded furniture than
that members of the family slept here.</p>

<p>A long corridor at the end of the first peristyle (<i>m</i>) connected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
the rooms at the right of the small atrium with the
closet (<i>n</i>), the bath (<i>o</i>, <i>o'</i>), the kitchen (M), and the large bedroom
(N) opening on the second peristyle. The two rooms of
the bath, tepidarium and caldarium, were provided with hollow
floors and walls, and were heated from the kitchen, into which
the draft vents (<a href="#Page_188">p. 188</a>) opened; in order to make the smoke
less objectionable, the kitchen was built very high, with several
windows.</p>

<p>The kitchen is of unusual size. A niche for the images of
the household gods was placed in the wall at the left, so high
up that it could only have been reached by means of a ladder.
The front is shaped to resemble the façade of a small temple,
and in it is a small altar of terra cotta for the burning of
incense.</p>

<p>The first room at the right of the corridor (<i>n'</i>) was completely
excavated in 1900, and found to be a stall. In it were brought
to light the skeletons of two cows and of four human beings, an
adult and three children.

<h3>CHAPTER 310VII<br />

<span class="s08"><i>A HOUSE NEAR THE PORTA MARINA</i></span></h3>

<p>The height of the important rooms can be accurately determined
in so few houses of the Tufa Period, that special importance
attaches to a house on the edge of the city north of the
Porta Marina (No.
13), in which not
merely the three-quarter
columns at the entrance
of the tablinum,
but also the pilasters
at the corners of the
fauces and alae and part
of the Ionic columns of
the peristyle are seen
in their full height.
The atrium is the best
preserved of any in
the large pre-Roman
houses, and the height of the ceiling in several of the adjoining
rooms is clearly indicated. The house lies about seventy paces
north of the Strada della Marina, on the last street leading to the
right. It is without a name and is seldom visited.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 345px;"><a name="fig144" id="fig144"></a>
<img src="images/fig144.jpg" width="343" height="251" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 144.&mdash;Plan of the house near the Porta Marina.<br />
<a href="images/fig144fs.jpg">View larger image</a></p>
</div>

<p>Neither the decoration, renewed in the second style and without
paintings, nor the arrangement of the rooms (<a href="#fig144">Fig. 144</a>) requires
extended comment. There are two atriums, the smaller
with the domestic apartments being at the left and entered directly
from the street. The fauces of the other are of unusual width,
being about two fifths of the width of the atrium. The alae are
at the middle of the sides, as in the house of Epidius Rufus and
the smaller atrium of the house of the Faun. At the sides of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
the tablinum are large windows opening into two dining rooms,
which are entered from the peristyle.</p>

<p>More than a third of the plot enclosed by the peristyle is taken
up by a deep rectangular basin for fish. At the rear are apparently
other rooms, adjusted to the slope of the ground, which,
however, have not yet been excavated.</p>

<p>It will, perhaps, be easier to appreciate the stately character of
the pre-Roman atriums if we give a few of the dimensions which
were used in making our restoration (<a href="#fig145">Fig. 145</a>).</p>

<p>The atrium is 41 by 29 feet. The tablinum measures 13 feet
9 inches between the three-quarter columns which stand, in
place of the usual pilasters, at the entrance; it is thus half as
wide as the atrium. The height of the tablinum at the entrance
is 18 feet 6 inches; according to the proportions given by Vitruvius
it should be 15 feet 4 inches.</p>

<p>The alae and fauces also exceed the dimensions presented by
the Roman architect, the former being 12⅔ feet wide and 16¼
feet high, while the height of the broad fauces, 17½ feet, is only
a trifle less than that of the tablinum.</p>

<p>The height of the walls of the atrium is easily determined
with the help of the data before us; and the arrangement of
the roof over the fauces, atrium, tablinum, and colonnade of
the peristyle must have been very similar to that shown in our
restoration. The entablature seen over the entrance of the left
ala is restored in accordance with the architectural forms commonly
used in the period when the house was built.</p>

<p>Both the three-quarter columns and the pilasters present a
peculiarity of construction found also in other houses, but not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
easy to explain. The former appear as half-columns on the side
of the tablinum, but present fully three fourths of their breadth
on the side of the atrium. The pilasters at the entrances of the
alae and fauces have, on the inside, a good proportion, the
breadth being about one eighth of the height; but on the outside,
toward the atrium, they are much more slender.</p>

<p>A well designed scroll pattern appears in the black and white
mosaic floor of the fauces, which, as often in Pompeian houses,
slopes gently toward the street. The floor of the atrium is made
of black mosaic with pieces of colored marble arranged in rows,
and white stripes at the edges. The base of a shrine for the
household gods stands against the right wall. In the first room
at the right was an alcove for a bed opposite the door; the ceiling
of the alcove, in the form of a vault, was lower than that of
the rest of the room.

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVIII<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE HOUSE OF THE SILVER WEDDING</i></span></h3>

<p>Among the more interesting of the large houses excavated in
the last decade is the house of the Silver Wedding, which marks
the limit of excavation in the fifth Region (V. ii. <i>a</i> on <a href="#plan6">Plan
VI</a>). The main part was cleared in 1892 (<a href="#fig008">Fig. 8</a>); and in April,
1893, in connection with the festivities with which the Silver
Wedding of the King and Queen of Italy was celebrated, a
special excavation was made in one of the rooms, in the presence
of their Majesties and of their imperial guests, the Emperor
and Empress of Germany. Portions of the house are still covered,
the façade, the inner end of the oecus, and the greater
part of an extensive garden on the left side.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the extent of the house&mdash;the greatest length
is not far from 150 feet, the breadth of the excavated portion
130&mdash;and the number of apartments, the plan is simple
(<a href="#fig146">Fig. 146</a>). From the fauces (<i>a</i>) we pass into a tetrastyle atrium
(<i>d</i>), the largest of its kind yet discovered, with alae on either
side and a high tablinum (<i>o</i>). Back of this is a Rhodian peristyle,
at the rear of which is an exedra (<i>y</i>) with sleeping rooms
at the right and the left (<i>x</i>, <i>z</i>). Opening into the rear of the
peristyle on one side is the oecus (4), on the other a long dining
room (<i>w</i>).</p>

<p>Another series of apartments lay between the peristyle and
the garden at the right (2), a kitchen (<i>s</i>), and a bath (<i>t-v</i>). In
front of the garden and extending to the street is a small house
(α-ι) which had been joined to the larger establishment; it was
connected with this by a small door under the stairs in the corner
of the atrium (β), which opened into a side room (<i>e</i>) of the large
atrium.</p>

<p>The essential parts of the house date from the Tufa Period.
Alterations were made from time to time in the course of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
two centuries during which it was occupied, but they were not
so extensive as to obscure the original plan. The most obvious
changes were those affecting the wall decoration.</p>

</div>

<p>In the small rooms at the right of the atrium are traces of the
decoration of the first
style, which was in
vogue when the house
was built. Toward
the end of the Republic
almost the whole interior
was redecorated
in the second style, but
without paintings.
Brilliant blocks and
panels dating from
this renovation may
still be seen upon the
upper part of the walls
of the atrium and on
those of the oecus, the
exedra, the two bedrooms
next to the exedra,
and the front part of
the long apodyterium.</p>

<p>Afterwards a few
rooms were done over
in the third style, of
which scanty remains
are found.</p>

<p>Lastly, after the
fourth style had come
into vogue, but before
60 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>&mdash;as shown by
an inscription on a column
of the peristyle&mdash;a large part of the house was redecorated
in the fourth style, including the tablinum, the andron and the
room at the right (<i>q</i>), the peristyle, the long dining room (<i>w</i>),
and the inner portion of the apodyterium. The lower part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
the walls of the atrium were also painted over, but with designs
and coloring that harmonized well with the decoration of
the second style above. In this house the history of Pompeian
wall decoration can be followed from the century after the Second
Punic War to the middle of the first century of our era, from
the time of Cato the Elder to that of Claudius and Nero. There
are few paintings, however, and they are not of special interest.</p>

<p>In marked contrast with the atriums in the house of the Faun
and the other houses which we have examined, the atrium here
had a relatively large compluvium (<a href="#fig147">Fig. 147</a>); all parts of the
room must have been brilliantly lighted. In summer some kind
of protection against the sun was a necessity. It was probably
afforded by hanging curtains between the columns; on the side
of each column, facing the corner of the atrium, is a bronze
ring through which a cord might have been passed to use in
drawing the curtains back and forth. The large compluvium
with its supporting columns suggests the arrangement of the
Corinthian atrium.</p>

<p>The dimensions of the atrium are monumental. The length
is approximately 54 feet, the breadth 40; and the Corinthian
columns of tufa coated with stucco, are 22¾ feet high.</p>

<p>At the rear of the impluvium is a fluted cistern curb of white
marble (seen in <a href="#fig008">Fig. 8</a>). In the impluvium near the edge is the
square pedestal of a fountain figure, which threw a jet into a
round marble basin in front.</p>

<p>The doors of the rooms at the sides of the atrium were originally
more than thirteen feet high; those which we now see are
comparatively low. The height was reduced because a second
floor was placed in the rooms, thus making low chambers,
which were reached by three stairways, one (<i>g</i>) at the right of
the atrium, the other two (<i>k</i> and <i>m</i>) on the opposite side. The
upper rooms were lighted by small windows, part of which
opened into the atrium, others upon the garden on the left side
of the house. These changes were completed before the atrium
received its decoration in the second style. There was no second
story over the alae, the tablinum, or the rooms about the
peristyle. In the left ala was once a large window opening on
the garden, but it was afterwards walled up (<a href="#Page_259">p. 259</a>).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span></p>

<p>The curtain fastenings on the pilasters at the front of the
tablinum have been referred to in another connection (<a href="#Page_256">p. 256</a>).
The arrangement of the rooms at the sides is not unlike that in
the house of Sallust; one, <i>n</i>, retained its original form; the
other was divided up into an andron (<i>p</i>), with a bedroom (<i>q</i>) at
one side.</p>

<p>The peristyle is remarkably well preserved. We find not only
the columns in their full height, but also, except on the north
side, large portions of the entablature, with its stucco ornamentation
intact, supported on a line of planks placed upon the
columns at the time of excavation; and the decoration of the
walls retains much of its brilliancy of coloring.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p>The colonnade of this peristyle has been mentioned elsewhere
as illustrating the Rhodian form (<a href="#Page_260">p. 260</a>). The difference in
height between the colonnade in front and on the other three
sides was accentuated in the decoration. On the walls in front
are large red panels separated by architectural designs on a
yellow background; the walls under the lower part of the colonnade
were painted with black panels, the designs of the narrow
intermediate sections being on a white background. The lower
third of the columns in front was yellow; at the sides and rear,
dark red, like that on the lower part of the high columns in the
atrium. Thus a pleasing contrast was made between the portions
of the colonnade designed to receive the sunshine, particularly
in winter, and the shadier parts; and the higher front
served as an intermediate member between the lofty atrium
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
with its stately tablinum and the lower rear division of the
house.</p>

<p>The ornamentation of the architrave retains no trace of the
decorative forms in vogue at the time when it was constructed.
The surface, moulded in stucco, is divided into sections, corresponding
with the capitals and intercolumniations, as in the
colonnade of the Stabian Baths (<a href="#fig089">Fig. 89</a>); in these sections are
small figures of birds and animals and other suitable designs,
the effect being heightened by the use of color.</p>

<p>That the decoration of the peristyle received its present form
before the earthquake is evident from an inscription scratched
upon the plaster of one of the columns on the north side:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Nerone Caesare Augusto<br />
Cosso Lentulo Cossi fil[io] co[n]s[ulibus]<br />
VIII Idus Febr[u]arias<br />
Dies Solis, Luna XIIIIX, nun[dinae] Cumis, V nun. Pompeis</i>,&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>'In the consulship of Nero and of Cossus Lentulus the son of
Cossus,' that is 60 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> The dates given in the rest of the inscription
are difficult to explain, and the reading of the number
after <i>Luna</i> is uncertain. The memorandum seems to indicate
that the eighth day before the Ides of February in this year
was the market day at Cumae, being Sunday and the sixteenth
day after the New Moon; and that the market day at Pompeii
came three days later. The inscription is the earliest yet found
in which a day of the week is named in connection with a date.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span></p>

<p>The garden plot enclosed by the peristyle was watered by
means of two jets at the front corners, fed by pipes under the
floor. In the middle was a slight elevation on which were found
two crocodiles, a huge toad, and a frog of a whitish glazed
earthenware, apparently made in Egypt. The figures are about
sixteen inches long.</p>

<p>Each of the bedrooms at the rear had an alcove for a bed,
the ceiling being vaulted over the alcove, flat between this
and the door; a distinction between the two parts of the room
was made also in the wall decoration and in the floor, of black
and white mosaic. The frescoing on the walls of the sleeping
rooms presents a brilliant variety of colors; the decoration of
the exedra is in yellow. One of the bedrooms has a small side
door (<a href="#Page_261">p. 261</a>). In the large dining room at the right (<i>w</i>) the
place for the table is indicated by an ornamental design in the
mosaic floor; in the oecus (4) the part of the room designed
for the table and couches is distinguished from the rest by a
difference in the decoration both of the floor and of the wall.</p>

<p>In the oecus, the excavation was made from which the house
received its name. The peristyle had already been cleared, and
the volcanic débris had been, for the most part, removed from
the front part of the oecus, leaving a layer at the bottom about
two feet deep. The King and Queen of Italy, with the Emperor
and Empress of Germany and a small suite, stationed
themselves in the corner of the peristyle opposite the opening
of the oecus; when all was ready a line of workmen proceeded
to draw back the loose fragments of pumice stone, exposing
the floor to view. Here nothing was found except the bronze
fastenings of the large doors; but a more fruitful outcome followed
a similar search in a room of a small house adjoining the
oecus on the south, in which several vessels of bronze were
brought to light.</p>

<p>The bath is unusually complete for a private house, comprising
a long, narrow apodyterium (<i>v</i>), an open-air swimming tank
in the garden (1), a tepidarium (<i>u</i>), and a caldarium (<i>t</i>). Steps
led down into the swimming tank at the corner nearest the
door of the apodyterium, and also on the side furthest from the
house; on the same side a jet fell into it from a marble standard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
adorned with a lion's head. If we imagine a thick growth
of shrubs and flowers about the tank, we have the setting which
explains the tasteful decoration of the frigidarium in the Stabian
Baths (<a href="#Page_191">p. 191</a>) and in the Baths near the Forum.</p>

<p>The pavement of the apodyterium is especially effective,
being composed of small bits of black, white, dark red, green,
and yellow marble and stone; near the rear wall a place for a
couch is left white.</p>

<p>The caldarium and the side of the tepidarium next to it
were provided with hollow walls; a hollow floor extended under
both rooms. In the left wall of the tepidarium is the bronze
mouth of a water pipe; perhaps in winter a cold bath was
taken here rather than in the swimming tank. In the caldarium
the niche for the labrum remains; the bath basin probably
stood opposite the entrance, where it could be easily heated
from the kitchen.</p>

<p>Above the broad hearth of the kitchen (<i>s</i>), which stands

painting of the two Lares; near them a serpent is seen coiled
around an altar, on which is a large pine cone. At the end next
the caldarium is a depression in the floor, for convenience in
building a fire to heat the bath rooms. In the corner is a foundation
of masonry to support the vessel, of lead, in which water
was kept for the bath.</p>

<p>The colonnade at the left of the house (6 on the Plan; see
<a href="#fig148">Fig. 148</a>), with its slender eight-sided columns, seems to have
been thrown down by the earthquake of 63, and removed. In
the place of four of the columns an open-air triclinium was made,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
like that in the house of Sallust. It is well preserved, and shows
an interesting peculiarity of construction. When the table was
not in use, a jet of water would spring from the foundation of
masonry supporting the round top. The water was conveyed
by a lead pipe, and at the rear of the colonnade one may still
see the stopcock by which the flow was regulated.</p>

<p>The stairway at the left of the small atrium (β) led to rooms
over the front of the house. Over the rooms at the rear, a bedroom
(γ), a central room (δ) taking the place of the tablinum,
and a corridor (ε), was a dining room, the front of which was supported
by columns (<a href="#Page_275">p. 275</a>), the stairway being in the corridor;
fragments of the tufa columns are lying on the floor. At the
back of the house was originally only the small sleeping room
(ζ) with a simple decoration in the first style, and a colonnade
(η) with Doric columns opening on the garden (κ). Later the
colonnade was turned into an apartment, and two rooms were
built at the left, a dining room (θ) and a bedroom (ι).</p>

<p>In the front of one of the rooms (λ) is an unusually well preserved
niche for the images of the household gods, ornamented
with stucco reliefs and painted in the last style. On the rear
wall stands Hercules, with the lion's skin hanging from his left
arm, his club on the left shoulder. In his right hand he holds
a large bowl above a round altar; at the left is a hog ready to
be offered as a victim.

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIX<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE HOUSE OF EPIDIUS RUFUS</i></span></h3>

<p>The house of Epidius Rufus, built, like those previously described,
in the pre-Roman time, presents a pleasing example of
a Corinthian atrium. In one respect it resembles the oldest
Pompeian houses, such as that of the Surgeon; in the place of
the peristyle is a garden extending back from a colonnade at
the rear of the tablinum. In a period when large peristyles
were the fashion, a Pompeian of wealth and taste, whose building
lot was ample enough to admit of an extension of his house
toward the rear, contented himself with a single group of rooms
arranged about one central apartment.</p>

<p>The arrangement of rooms is seen at a glance (<a href="#fig149">Fig. 149</a>). The
vestibule, like that of the principal entrance in the house of the
Faun, had a triple door at the end toward the street (shown in
<a href="#fig150">Fig. 150</a>), which was no doubt left open in the daytime. Entering,
one would pass into the fauces ordinarily through the small
door at the right (<a href="#Page_248">p. 248</a>), the large double doors between the
vestibule and the fauces only being opened for the reception of
clients or on special occasions.</p>

<p>The front of each ala (7, 13) is adorned with two Ionic columns.
At the corners of the entrances are pilasters, the Corinthian
capitals of which have a striking ornament, a female head,
moulded in stucco, looking out from the midst of the acanthus
leaves. The eyes and hair are painted, and in one instance the
features of a bacchante can be recognized.</p>

<p>In the right ala is an elaborate house shrine, built like a temple
with a façade supported by columns, raised on a podium five
feet high (<a href="#fig151">Fig. 151</a>). On the front of the podium is a dedicatory
inscription to the Genius of the master (<a href="#Page_270">p. 270</a>).</p>

<p>The tablinum originally opened on the atrium in its full width,
the entrance being set off by pilasters at the corners. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
then higher; when the
entrance was changed
the height was reduced
to about twelve
feet. The sixteen
Doric columns about
the impluvium, well
preserved for the
most part, are only a
trifle over fourteen
feet high.</p>

</div>

<p>The contrast between
this atrium and
the lofty halls of the
houses of Sallust and
the Faun was indeed
marked. Here the
atrium had become
more like a court than
a hall; yet the impluvium,
paved with
tufa, was retained,
and we find the same
arrangement for the
flow of water as in
many houses with
Tuscan and tetrastyle
atriums. On the edge
of the impluvium at
the rear is the pedestal
of a fountain figure
which threw a jet
into a basin resting
on two rectangular
standards; the places
of these, as well as
the course of the feed
pipe, are indicated on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
the plan. Behind the pedestal is a round cistern curb; another
jet rose in the middle of the impluvium.</p>

<p>The apartment at the right of the tablinum (20) was a dining
room. Of the smaller rooms about the atrium, three (6, 8, and
12) were sleeping rooms for members of the family; some of
the others were so poorly decorated as to prompt the suggestion
that they were intended for slaves. That next the stairs (14)
was a storeroom; the traces of the shelving are easily distinguished.
Under the stairs was a low room (16), perhaps used
for a similar purpose; the small double room (17) was also low,
and used as a sleeping room.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig150" id="fig150"></a>

</div>

<p>The domestic apartments were reached by the andron (18).
In the kitchen (21) is a broad hearth (<i>b</i>); a dim light was furnished
by narrow windows. The little room at the entrance of
the kitchen (<i>a</i>) was perhaps a storeroom; the closet, as often,
was in the corner of the kitchen.</p>

<p>At the opposite end of the colonnade is the gardener's room
(23). The main part of the garden (24), as indicated by the
arrangement of the ground, was used for vegetables; the small
flower garden at the rear (25) was on a higher level.</p>

<p>In the house originally there was no second floor. In the
Roman period, apparently near the end of the Republic, a large
upper room&mdash;probably a dining room&mdash;was built over the
kitchen; and there may have been one or two small storerooms
at the head of the stairway which was built in one of the side
rooms of the atrium.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span></p>

<p>Traces of the first and third decorative styles are found in the
atrium; but the most interesting remains are those of the last
style. The alae and several rooms were redecorated shortly
before the destruction of the city. The dining room (20) contains
a series of paintings illustrating the contest between Apollo
and Marsyas; they are skilfully displayed in a light architectural
framework on a white ground. On the wall at the left (at <i>a</i>)
Apollo is seen with left foot advanced, striking with his right
hand a large cithara which rests against his left shoulder. Opposite
him (at <i>b</i>) is Marsyas, playing the double flute; on the intervening
panels (<i>d</i>, <i>e</i>) are the Muses, who are acting as judges in
the contest of skill. The painting at <i>c</i> seems to relate to Apollo,
but the subject has not been explained. The choice of subjects
such as these may have been influenced by the cult of the early
divinity of the city; but it probably implies a taste for poetry
and music on the part of the proprietor.</p>

<p>There were no shops in the front of this house, but in one
respect our restoration of the façade (<a href="#fig150">Fig. 150</a>) can not be taken
as indicating the appearance of such houses in general. Here
the front line was set back several feet from that of the adjoining
houses on either side, and the space thus gained was given
to a terrace or ramp about four feet high, mounted by steps at
either end. The elevation of the front entrance above the sidewalk
and the placing of the approaches at the ends of the ramp
gave the house an appearance of seclusion.

<h3>CHAPTER XL<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE HOUSE OF THE TRAGIC POET</i></span></h3>

<p>In the "Last Days of Pompeii" the house of the Tragic Poet
is presented to us as the home of Glaucus. Though not large,
it was among the most attractive in the city. It received its
present form and decoration not many years before the eruption,
apparently after the earthquake of 63, and well illustrates the
arrangements of the Pompeian house of the last years.</p>

<p>The house received its name at the time of excavation, in
consequence of a curious misinterpretation of a painting&mdash;now
in the Naples Museum&mdash;which was found in the tablinum.
The subject is the delivery to Admetus of the oracle which
declared that he must die unless some one should voluntarily
meet death in his place. On one side sits Admetus, with his
devoted queen Alcestis; opposite them is the messenger who is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
reading the oracle from a roll of papyrus. The excavators
thought that the scene represented a poet reciting his verses;
and since they found, in the floor of the tablinum, a mosaic
picture in which an actor is seen making preparations for the
stage, they concluded that the figure with the papyrus in the
wall painting must be a tragic poet.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 153.&mdash;View of the house of the Tragic Poet, looking from the middle of the atrium
through the tablinum toward the shrine at the end of the peristyle.<br />
At the right, the andron. In the foreground, a cistern curb, at the rear of the impluvium.</p>
</div>

<p>The plan (<a href="#fig152">Fig. 152</a>) presents slight irregularities; yet in
essential points the arrangement of rooms does not differ materially
from that which we have found in the houses of the pre-Roman
time. As our section (<a href="#fig154">Fig. 154</a>) shows, all the parts of
the house are comparatively low; the ceiling of the atrium and
of the large dining room at the rear (15) were only a few
feet higher than the colonnade of the peristyle. The entrances
of the ala&mdash;here there is but one&mdash;and of the tablinum are
not adorned with pilasters; plain wooden casings were used
instead. The second story rooms are not an afterthought but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
a part of the architect's design; the stairways (4) leading to
them are symmetrically placed at the sides of the atrium. There
was no upper floor, however, over the fauces, the atrium, or the
tablinum. To a modern visitor this dwelling would have seemed
more homelike and comfortable than the monumental houses of
the earlier time.</p>

<p>The large shops (2) are both connected with the house by
doors opening into the fauces (1). They were doubtless the
proprietor's place of business. In one of them gold ornaments
were found, but we should scarcely be warranted in
assuming from this fact that the master of the house was a
goldsmith.</p>

<p>In the floor of the fauces, immediately behind the double
front door, is a dog, attached to a chain, outlined in black and
white mosaic, with the inscription, <i>cave canem</i>, 'Beware of the
dog!' The picture was for many years in the Naples Museum.
The black and white mosaic is well preserved in the atrium, the
tablinum (<a href="#fig153">Fig. 153</a>), and the dining room opening on the peristyle,
as well as in the fauces.</p>

<p>The purpose of the various rooms is in most cases easy to
determine. The first at the left of the atrium (5) was the room
of the porter, <i>atriensis</i>. The three rooms marked 6 were sleeping
rooms, as were also 12 and 14 opening on the peristyle;
6' was a storeroom, 13 the kitchen. There was a colonnade on
three sides of the peristyle; against the wall at the rear stands
the shrine of the household gods (seen in <a href="#fig153">Fig. 153</a>) in which
was found a marble statuette of a satyr carrying fruits in the
fold of a skin hanging in front of him.</p>

<p>The decoration of the large dining room (15) is especially
effective. In the front of the room is a broad door opening
into the colonnade of the peristyle; each of the three sides contains
three panels, in the midst of a light but carefully finished
architectural framework. In the central panels are large paintings:
at <i>r</i>, a young couple looking at a nest of Cupids; at <i>q</i>,
Theseus going on board ship, leaving behind him the beautiful
Ariadne; and at <i>p</i> a composition in which Artemis is the principal
figure. In four of the smaller panels are the Seasons,
represented as graceful female figures hovering in the air; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
others present youthful warriors with helmet, shield, sword, and
spear, all well conceived and executed with much delicacy.</p>

<p>The atrium, unlike most of those at Pompeii, was rich in wall
paintings. Six panels, more than four feet high, presented a
series of scenes from the story of the Trojan war, as told in the
"Iliad." These were united with the decorative framework in
such a way as to make a harmonious and pleasing whole; the
main divisions of the right wall of the atrium, as well as of the
fauces and tablinum, are indicated in <a href="#fig154">Fig. 154</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>In arranging the pictures, the decorators had little regard for
the order of events. The subjects were the Nuptials of Zeus
and Hera (at <i>a</i> on the plan); the judgment of Paris (<i>b</i>)&mdash;though
this is doubtful, as the picture is now entirely obliterated;
the delivery of Briseis to the messenger of Agamemnon
(<i>c</i>); the departure of Chryseis (<i>d</i>), and seemingly Thetis bringing
arms across the sea to Achilles (<i>f</i>). Of the painting at <i>e</i>
only a fragment remained, too small to make it possible to recognize
the subject. The fragment at <i>f</i>, in which were seen a
Triton, two figures riding on a sea horse, and a Cupid on a
dolphin, is now entirely faded. Half of the painting in which
Chryseis appears was already ruined at the time of excavation;
the other half was transferred to the Naples Museum, together
with the paintings that were best preserved, the Nuptials of
Zeus and Hera, and the sending away of Briseis.</p>

<p>The two pictures last mentioned are among the best known
of the Pompeian paintings, and have often been reproduced. In
one (<a href="#fig273">Fig. 273</a>) we see Zeus sitting at the right, while Hypnos
presents to him Hera, whose left wrist he gently grasps in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
right hand as if to draw her to him. Hera seems half reluctant,
and her face, which the artist, in order to enhance the
effect, has directed toward the beholder rather than toward
Zeus, is queenly in its majesty and power. The scene is
located on Mt. Ida. In the background stands a pillar, on
which are three small figures of lions; below at the side are
two pipes, cymbals, and a tambourine, all sacred to the potent
divinity of Mt. Ida, Cybele. Three youths, crowned with garlands,
appear in the lower right hand corner of the picture;
they are perhaps the Dactyli, demons skilled in the working of
metals who followed in the train of Cybele.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig155" id="fig155"></a>
<img src="images/fig155.jpg" width="393" height="478" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 155.&mdash;The sending away of Briseis.<br />
Wall painting from the house of the Tragic Poet.</p>
</div>

<p>A higher degree of dramatic interest is manifested in the
other painting, which we present in outline (<a href="#fig155">Fig. 155</a>). In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
foreground at the right, Patroclus leads forward the weeping
Briseis. In the middle Achilles, seated, looks toward Patroclus
with an expression of anger, and with an impatient gesture of
the right hand directs him to deliver up the beautiful captive
to the messenger of Agamemnon, who stands at the left waiting
to receive her. Behind Achilles is Phoenix, his faithful
companion, who tries to soften his anger with comforting words.
Further back the helmeted heads of warriors are seen, and at
the rear the tent of Achilles.</p>

<p>The scene is well conceived. Yet in both this picture and
the one previously described, the composition seems to lack
depth and perspective. The artist is remarkably skilful in
portraying facial expression, and foreground details; his limitations
are apparent in the handling of groups. We have the
feeling that the first designs were not made freely with brush or
pencil, but that the artist was here translating into painting
designs which he found already worked out in reliefs. The
original paintings, of which these are copies, very likely go
back to the fourth century <span class="s08">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Another painting worthy of more than passing mention was
found on a wall of the peristyle (at <i>o</i>), and removed to the
Naples Museum. The subject is the sacrifice of Iphigenia,
who was to be offered up to Artemis that a favorable departure
from Aulis might be granted to the Greek fleet assembled for
the expedition against Troy (<a href="#fig156">Fig. 156</a>).</p>

<p>At the right stands Calchas, deeply troubled, his sheath in
his left hand, his unsheathed sword in his right, his finger upon
his lips. The hapless maid with arms outstretched in supplication
is held by two men, one of whom is perhaps Ulysses. At
the left is Agamemnon, with face averted and veiled head, overcome
with grief. Beside him leans his sceptre, and on a pillar
near by we see an archaic statue of Artemis with a torch in
each hand, a dog on either side. Just as the girl is to be slain,
Artemis appears in the sky at the right, and from the clouds
opposite a nymph emerges bringing a deer, which the goddess
accepts as a substitute.</p>

<p>In this painting, also, though the style is entirely different
from that of the others, we perceive the limitations of the artist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
in the treatment of the background. Nevertheless the boldness
of the conception, and the skill manifested in the handling
of several of the figures, seem to point to an original of more
than ordinary merit.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig156" id="fig156"></a>
<img src="images/fig156.jpg" width="532" height="545" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 156.&mdash;The sacrifice of Iphigenia.<br />
Wall painting.</p>
</div>

<p>Not far from 400 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> the sacrifice of Iphigenia was made
the subject of a painting by Timanthes, in which the maiden
was represented as standing beside the altar. We are told that
the artist painted Calchas sorrowful, Ulysses more sorrowful,
Ajax lamenting, and Menelaus in sorrow so deep that deeper
sorrow could not be expressed; finding it impossible to portray
the grief of the father, Agamemnon, Timanthes represented
him with veiled head.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span></p>

<p>The veiled Agamemnon appears in our painting, and the figure
of Calchas perhaps reflects the conception of Timanthes.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a relation between the
two pictures; even if we did not know that Iphigenia, in the
painting of Timanthes, stood beside an altar, we could scarcely
believe that a great painter would have represented her thus
awkwardly carried. Undoubtedly the Pompeian painting, or its
original, is indebted to the masterpiece of the Greek artist;
but the decorative painter has adapted this to suit his purpose,
omitting the figures, the facial expression of which was
most difficult to reproduce, and at the same time attempting to
heighten the effect by making more prominent the helplessness
and terror of the victim.

<h3>CHAPTER XLI<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE HOUSE OF THE VETTII</i></span></h3>

<p>The house of the Vettii, excavated in the years 1894-1895,
bears the same relation to the other houses built in the Roman
period that the house of the Faun does to those of the earlier
time; it is the most important representative of its class. It
was situated in a quiet part of the city, and was not conspicuous
by reason of its size; its interest for us lies chiefly in its paintings
and in the adornment of the well preserved peristyle.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig157" id="fig157"></a>
<img src="images/fig157.jpg" width="527" height="387" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 157.&mdash;Exterior of the house of the Vettii, restored.</p>
</div>

<p>The relationship between the two owners, Aulus Vettius
Restitutus and Aulus Vettius Conviva (<a href="#Page_508">p. 508</a>) is not known.
They were perhaps freedmen, manumitted by the same master;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
Conviva, as we learn from a painted inscription, was a member of
the Brotherhood of Augustus,&mdash;<i>Vetti Conviva, Augustal[is]</i>.</p>

<p>The exterior of the house (<a href="#fig157">Fig. 157</a>) was unpretentious. The
main entrance was on the east side, and there was a side door
near the southeast corner; elsewhere the street walls were unbroken
except by small,
square windows, part
of which were in low
second story rooms.</p>

<p>The vestibule
(<a href="#fig158">Fig. 158</a>, <i>a</i>), as in the house
of Epidius Rufus (p.
248), was connected
with the fauces (<i>b</i>) by
a large double door and
also by a small door at
the right. The atrium
(<i>c</i>) is without a tablinum;
at the rear it
opens directly on the
peristyle. One of the
alae (<i>h</i>) at the time of
the eruption was used
as a wardrobe. At the
sides of the atrium were
two money chests; the
one at the right is seen
in <a href="#fig159">Fig. 159</a>.</p>

<p>Opening on the peristyle
are three large
apartments (<i>n</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>), and two smaller rooms (<i>o</i>, <i>r</i>). A door at
the right leads into a small side peristyle (<i>s</i>, shown in <a href="#fig160">Fig. 160</a>),
with a quiet dining room (<i>t</i>) and bedroom (<i>u</i>).</p>

<p>The domestic apartments were near the front of the house.
At the right of the principal atrium is a small side atrium (<i>v</i>)
without a separate street entrance. Grouped about it were
rooms for the slaves and the kitchen (<i>w</i>) with a large hearth
(<a href="#fig125">Fig. 125</a>). Beyond the kitchen is a room for the cook (<i>x'</i>).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
At the rear of the small atrium is the niche for the household
gods (<a href="#fig127">Fig. 127</a>).</p>

<p>The corridor at the left of the principal atrium (γ) led to an
unimportant room (β) with a door opening on a side street. In
this corridor there was a stairway to the second story, which
extended over this corner of the house (above <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, β, δ).
Along the front also were low chambers, over the fauces and
the small rooms on either side (<i>d</i>, <i>k</i>), and over the rooms adjoining
the small atrium (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>).</p>

<p>In the accompanying sections two restorations of the interior
are given. In the first (<a href="#fig159">Fig. 159</a>) we are looking toward the
right side of the atrium and the inner end of the peristyle;
the depth of the peristyle more than equals that of the atrium,
together with the vestibule and fauces. The difference in
height between the atrium and the peristyle, as in the house
of the Tragic Poet, is much less than in the houses built in the
pre-Roman period; and the corners of the alae were protected
by simple wooden casings, altogether unlike the stately pilasters
of the olden time.</p>

<p>The transverse section (<a href="#fig160">Fig. 160</a>) presents the long side of the
peristyle next to the atrium, with the side of the small peristyle
at the north end. The extent of the house is greater measured
across the two peristyles (along the line C-D on the plan) than
from front to rear. Of the three entrances from the atrium
into the peristyle, that in the middle is broader and higher
than the other two, which are not much wider than ordinary
doors; the arrangement of the openings is similar to that in
houses having a tablinum open toward the peristyle with an
andron on one side, and on the other a room with a door corresponding
with the door of the andron.</p>

<p>The columns of the peristyle are well preserved (<a href="#fig161">Fig. 161</a>).
They are white, with ornate capitals moulded in stucco and
painted with a variety of colors. Part of the entablature also
remains; the architrave is ornamented with an acanthus arabesque
in white stucco relief on a yellow background.</p>

<p>The roof of the greater part of the colonnade has been
restored, and the garden has been planted with shrubs in
accordance with the arrangement indicated by the appearance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
of the ground at the time of excavation. Nowhere else in
Pompeii will the visitor so easily gain an impression of the
aspect presented by a peristyle in ancient times. The main
part of the house was searched for objects of value after the
eruption, but the garden was left undisturbed, and we see in
it to-day the fountain basins, statuettes, and other sculptures
placed there by the proprietor.</p>

<p>In each corner of the colonnade is a round fountain basin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
(indicated on the plan), at each side an oblong basin, all of
marble. Jets fell into them from statuettes standing on pedestals
beside the columns; there were two figures for each side
basin, one each for those at the corners. The two statuettes
at the inner end of the colonnade (<a href="#fig162">Fig. 162</a>) are of bronze;
they represent a boy with a duck, from the bill of which the
water spurted. The rest are of marble, and not of special
interest. Among them are a Bacchus and two satyrs. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
water pipes were so well preserved that it has been found
possible to place them in repair, and they are now ready for
use. There were also two fountains in the garden.</p>

<p>Near the middle of the garden is a round, marble table. Three
others stand under the colonnade, one of which, at the right
near the inner end, is particularly elegant. The three feet are
carved to represent lions' claws; the heads above are well executed,
and there are traces of yellow color on the manes. On
two pillars in the garden are double busts, the subjects of which
are taken from the bacchic cycle. One represents Bacchus and
a bacchante (<a href="#fig257">Fig. 257</a>), the other Bacchus and Ariadne; there
are traces of painting on the hair, beard, and eyes.</p>

<p>The wall paintings of this house are the most remarkable yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
discovered at Pompeii. Although the decoration of which they
form a part is throughout of the fourth style, they fall into two
groups, an earlier and a later, distinguished by differences in
composition and handling that are easily perceived.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig162" id="fig162"></a>
<img src="images/fig162.jpg" width="535" height="389" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 162.&mdash;Peristyle of the house of the Vettii, looking south from the colonnade
at the north end.</p>
</div>

<p>The earlier paintings are found in the atrium (<i>c</i>), the alae
(<i>h, i</i>), and the large room at the end of the peristyle (<i>q</i>). At
the time when they were painted the left ala (<i>h</i>) was connected
with the room behind it (<i>n</i>) by a door, and had a large window
opening on the peristyle like that in the other ala (seen in
<a href="#fig160">Fig. 160</a>). Afterwards both window and door were walled up and
the ala was turned into a wardrobe. After this change had
been made, as the remains of the masonry show, the earthquake
of 63 threw down a part of the wall between the ala and the
peristyle. The earlier paintings, then, must have been placed
upon the walls before the year 63, in the reign of Claudius or
the earlier part of the reign of Nero.</p>

<p>The later pictures are on the walls of the fauces (<i>b</i>), the large
apartment at the left of the atrium (<i>e</i>), the colonnade of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
peristyle (<i>l</i>), the two dining rooms opening on the peristyle
(<i>n</i>, <i>p</i>), and the small peristyle (<i>s</i>) with the adjoining rooms (<i>t</i>, <i>u</i>);
to the same class belongs also the painting of the Genius with
the Lares in the side atrium (<i>v</i>), which, aside from this, contains
no pictures. The remaining rooms present nothing of
interest.</p>

<p>The paintings of the first group are characterized by refinement
in the choice of subjects, fertility in the composition, firmness
of touch in the drawing, and exquisite finish in even the
smallest details. The colors used are simple and harmonious,
violent contrasts being avoided. A number of these pictures
show the hand of a true artist, whose work has been found in
no other house, and the system of decoration is the most effective
of its kind in Pompeii.</p>

<p>The decoration of the walls painted after the earthquake is
not unlike that found in other houses upon walls of the fourth
style. The designs are sketchy and without painstaking in the
handling of details; the lines are coarse, the colors sometimes
crude. The pictures in the panels are by different painters,
some of whom were not without skill, yet none far above the
average. One of the decorators had a fondness for representing
mythological death scenes, manifesting a taste little short
of barbarous.</p>

<p>The contrast between the earlier and the later decoration is so
marked that it seems impossible to explain except on the assumption
of a change of owners. We may well believe that about
the middle of the first century this was the home of a family of
culture and standing, who secured for the decoration of it the
best artist that could be obtained, bringing him perhaps from
Rome or from a Greek city. But within a score of years afterwards
the house passed into the hands of the Vettii, freedmen,
perhaps, whose taste in matters of art was far inferior to that of
the former occupants, and a number of rooms were redecorated.</p>

<p class="caption">PLATE VIII.&mdash;TWO WALL PAINTINGS IN THE HOUSE OF THE VETTII</p>
</div>

<p>The excellent preservation of a large part of both the earlier
and the later decoration gives the house the appearance of an
art gallery. To describe fully and interpret all the paintings
would require a small volume. The limitations of space make
it possible to present here only the more important; we commence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
with those in the large room at the right of the peristyle,
which are the most interesting of the entire series.</p>

<p>This apartment (<i>q</i>) may have been used either as a dining
room or as a sitting room. The scheme of decoration is indicated
in <a href="#fig163">Fig. 163</a>, which presents the
division of the end wall; the side
walls had five large panels instead of
three.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 205px;"><a name="fig163" id="fig163"></a>
<img src="images/fig163.jpg" width="201" height="198" alt="" />

in the large room opening on
the peristyle.<br />
<a href="images/fig163fs.jpg">View larger image</a></p>
</div>

<p>The ground of the base is black.
The stripe separating the base from
the main part of the wall is red, except
the small sections (4, 4), which
have a black ground; the vertical
stripes between the panels are black,
and the same color forms the background
of the border above. The
ground of the panels is cinnabar red.
The painting in the central panel (1) has not been preserved; in
those at the sides (2) are floating figures. The upper division
of the wall (6) is filled with an architectural framework upon
a white background, against which many figures, skilfully disposed,
stand out with unusual distinctness.</p>

<p>The floating figures in the side panels differ from those found
elsewhere in the choice of subjects. Here instead of satyrs and
bacchantes we find gods and heroes. In one panel is Poseidon
with a female figure, perhaps Amymone; in another, Apollo with
Daphne. Bacchus and Ariadne also appear, and Perseus with
Andromeda.</p>

<p>The figures in the upper part of the wall at the end of the
room belong to the bacchic cycle,&mdash;Silenus, satyrs, and bacchantes.
Of those at the sides, one, near the right-hand corner,
represents a poet with a roll of papyrus against his chin, the
open manuscript case, <i>scrinium</i>, at his feet; opposite him sits a
maiden clothed in white, drinking in his words. A comic mask
on the left wall seems to suggest a writer of comedy, and the
scene reminds one of the letter of Glycera to Menander, in
Alciphron: "What is Athens without Menander, what Menander
without Glycera? Without me, who make ready your masks, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
lay out your costume, and then stand behind the scenes pressing
my finger tips into the palms of my hands till the applause breaks
forth. Then all a-trembling I breathe again, and enfold you,
godlike poet, in my arms."</p>

<p>The figures in which we are specially interested, however, are
not those in the upper or middle division of the wall, but those
in the black stripes (3), nine and ten inches wide, under the
panels, in the narrow sections (4) and in the corresponding
sections of the base.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig164" id="fig164"></a>
<img src="images/fig164.jpg" width="402" height="177" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 164.&mdash;Psyches gathering flowers.<br />
Wall painting in the house of the Vettii.</p>
</div>

<p>In each of the sections at the bottom is a standing figure. In
those of the end wall (5) are a satyr and a bacchante; in the
two nearest the middle of each side wall are Amazons, in the
rest female figures with implements of sacrifice. The Amazons,
armed with battle-axe and shield, are full of life; they are distinguished
by the colors of their mantles and their Phrygian caps.</p>

<p>In the narrow sections on the end walls (4), and all but four
of the others, were Psyches gathering flowers. Only a part of
the scenes are preserved; in each are three figures, grouped
with a pleasing variety and rendered with singular delicacy of
touch. In one, the Psyches are sprightly children (<a href="#fig164">Fig. 164</a>);
in another, young girls; and in a third we see a lady sitting at
ease and plucking the flowers close at hand, while two maids
gather the blossoms beyond her reach.</p>

<p>The two narrow sections nearest the middle panel of each
side wall contained mythological scenes, of which three are preserved.
The subjects are taken from the cycle of myths relating
to Apollo and Artemis. In one of the pictures both the divinities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
appear. Apollo has just slain the Python, which lies coiled
about the Omphalos, the sacred symbol of the god as the giver
of oracles at Delphi. His bow and quiver are hanging upon a
column in the background, and he moves forward with vigorous
step singing the Paean with an accompaniment upon the cithara.
At the right, Artemis, with a quiver and long hunting spear,
leans upon a pillar looking at her brother. Nearer the Omphalos
are a priest and a female attendant, with a bull intended for
sacrifice; the relation of these to the rest of the scene is not
clear (<a href="#plate08">Plate VIII</a>.).</p>

<p>The companion picture takes us to a sanctuary dedicated to
Artemis. At the left a gilt bronze image of the goddess, in
hunting costume, stands upon a pillar, to the side of which a
bow, quiver, and boar's head are fastened. On one side of the
round altar in the middle is a white hind, sacred to the goddess;
on the other, moving toward it with a sword in the uplifted right
hand, is a kingly figure, the face turned with a wild and threatening
look toward a frightened attendant; another attendant,
back of the hind, seems not yet to have noticed the sacrilegious
intruder. The composition is full of dramatic power; the subject
can be none other than the slaying of the hind of Artemis
by the impious Agamemnon (<a href="#plate08">Plate VIII</a>.).</p>

<p>The third of these small paintings presents a scene not infrequently
met with on Pompeian walls, Orestes and Pylades at
Tauris in the presence of King Thoas, and of Iphigenia, who is
now a priestess of Artemis. The conception is akin to that of
the painting in the house of the Citharist (<a href="#fig182">Fig. 182</a>), but the
picture is partially obliterated.</p>

<p>The long stripe below the panels is preserved in more than
half its length, on the end wall (3), on that at the right, and on
the short sections of the front wall; there is also a fragment on
the left side. It contains a series of charming pictures representing
Cupids and Psyches. Some of the little creatures are
engaged in sports, others are celebrating a festival, while others
still are busying themselves with the manifold work of everyday
life. The execution is less careful than in the small mythological
pictures; yet the figures are so full of life, their movements are
so purposeful, and their bearing so suggestive that we seem to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
catch the expression of the tiny faces. The Cupids and Psyches,
whether playing the part of children or of men and women in
elegant attire, whether garland makers or vinedressers or smiths,
are always Cupids and Psyches still; we instinctively recognize
them as such, not by reason of outward attributes so much as
by their bearing. Prosaic daily toil has nowhere been more
happily idealized.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig165" id="fig165"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 165.&mdash;Cupids making and selling oil.<br />
Wall painting in the house of the Vettii.</p>
</div>

<p>The Cupids at the left of the entrance are playing with a
duck. One holds the duck under his arm ready to let it go;
the other stretches out his hands to catch it as it tries to escape.
The group on the other side are throwing at a wooden mark.
One is setting up the target. Two are making ready to throw,
one of them being mounted on the back of a companion; the
successful contestant in such games was called "the king," the
loser, "the ass," because he had to carry the others upon his
back. A fifth stands ruefully beside the target, awaiting his
turn to carry the victor.</p>

<p>Among the most attractive groups are those of the flower
dealers, at the end of the right wall near the entrance. First
we see the gardener leading to market a goat laden with roses;
his little son trudges along behind the animal, carrying a basket
of roses suspended from a stick on the left shoulder. Next is
the dealer, who stands behind a broad marble table covered
with garlands; he is handing two to a youth who already has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
several, while a Psyche near by is placing the garlands in a
basket. Beyond these, workmen are making garlands, which
hang in profusion from a wooden frame. At the extreme left
is a lady asking the price. One of the workmen holds up
two fingers, signifying two asses. The price of a wreath is
given in a graffito as three asses (<a href="#Page_497">p. 497</a>).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 220px;"><a name="fig166" id="fig166"></a>
<img src="images/fig166.jpg" width="217" height="167" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 166.&mdash;Oil press. From a wall
painting found at Herculaneum.</p>
</div>

<p>In the following scene Cupids appear as makers and sellers
of oil (<a href="#fig165">Fig. 165</a>). At the right is the oil press. It stands upon
a square stone, the upper surface of which contains a semicircular
incision to catch the oil and carry it to a round vessel standing
in front. The two sides, each with a broad vertical opening,
are securely fastened by a crosspiece at the top. The ends of
four horizontal boards are fitted to the openings, in which they
move up and down. The olives are
placed under the lowest board; in the
spaces between the others, and between
the upper board and the crosspiece,
thick wooden wedges are driven.
As the workmen drive in the wedges
with heavy mallets, the pressure upon
the olives is increased, and the oil is
forced out. The arrangement may
be more plainly seen in <a href="#fig166">Fig. 166</a>, from
a wall painting at Herculaneum, in which a similar press appears.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span></p>

<p>At the left of the press is a large kettle resting on a tripod.
The oil is being stirred as it is heated; a similar kettle appears
in the scene in a shop presented in the other part of the picture.
Further on are two figures beside a deep vessel, but the process
represented is not clear.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig167" id="fig167"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 167.&mdash;Cupids as goldsmiths,<br />
Wall painting in the house of the Vettii.</p>
</div>

<p>The rest of the picture relates to the selling of oil. In the
background is a cupboard, with a statuette&mdash;possibly an Aphrodite&mdash;on
the upper shelf. In front is an open chest resting
on four legs. Both the cupboard and the box contain bottles
and jars of various shapes and sizes for holding oil; a Cupid
has just taken one up. On the top of the chest is a roll of
papyrus with a pair of scales; oil was sold by weight. A
memorandum on the wall of an adjoining house reads: <i>XIII.
K. Fe. oli. p. DCCCXXXX</i>,&mdash;'January 20, 840 pounds of oil.'</p>

<p>The central figure of the group at the left is the lady who has
come to make a purchase. A cushioned seat has been placed
for her, with a footstool; the maid stands motionless behind, a
large fan resting on the right shoulder. The proprietor holds
in his right hand a spoon containing a sample which he has just
taken from the jar under his arm; the lady seems to be testing
the quality on the back of her wrist. The article sold is doubtless
the fine perfumed oil, not the common variety.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span></p>

<p>Hardly less animated are the scenes in which Cupids take
the place of goldsmiths (<a href="#fig167">Fig. 167</a>). At the right is the furnace,
adorned with the head of Hephaestus, the patron divinity of
workers in metals. In front is a Cupid with a blowpipe and
pincers. Behind it another is working with a graver's tool upon
a large gold vessel. The pose, suggesting at the same time
exertion and perfect steadiness, is rendered with remarkable
skill.</p>

<p>Next is a figure at a small anvil; then the counter for the sale
of jewellery, which is displayed in three open drawers. Behind
the case containing the drawers a large and a smaller pair
of scales are seen.</p>

<p>The first two figures in the other half of the picture represent
a lady purchaser, seated, and the proprietor, who weighs out
an object with a small pair of scales. The left hands of both
point to the balance; they are deeply interested in the weighing.
Lastly, we see two figures at an anvil. Nothing could be
more natural than the pose of the one at the left, holding the
metal upon the anvil for his companion to strike, yet drawing
back as far as possible in order to avoid the sparks.</p>

<p>The processes of the fullery also are illustrated,&mdash;treading
the clothes in vats, carding, inspection of the cloth to see if the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
work is properly done, and folding the finished garments for
delivery to the owners.</p>

<p>Three of the pictures&mdash;two on the end wall and one on the
left side&mdash;relate to wine.</p>

<p>The first is a vintage scene (<a href="#fig168">Fig. 168</a>), of which only a part
is distinct. At the left is a Cupid gathering grapes, from vines
trained to run from tree to tree. The press is worked on a
different principle from the one shown in <a href="#fig165">Fig. 165</a>. Here two
Cupids are turning a windlass by means of long levers. The
windlass is connected by a pulley with a press beam above; as
the end of this is gradually lowered, the pressure upon the
grapes underneath is increased.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig168" id="fig168"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 168.&mdash;Vintage scene: Cupids gathering and pressing grapes.<br />
Wall painting in the house of the Vettii.</p>
</div>

<p>The triumph of Bacchus is presented in another picture,
which is fortunately in a better state of preservation. At the
head of the procession is a bacchante, riding on a panther.
Bacchus sits in a four-wheeled chariot drawn by goats; the
coachman is a satyr. Behind the triumphal car is Pan, dancing
and playing the double flute; last comes a vine-crowned
Cupid, dancing, with a large mixing bowl upon his shoulder.
The skill shown in the pose of the dancing figures is especially
noteworthy; they stand lightly erect, seeming not to feel their
weight or the exertion of rapid movement.</p>

<p>In the last of this series, upon the left wall, Cupids appear
as wine dealers; the part of the picture that has been preserved
is shown in <a href="#fig169">Fig. 169</a>. The rustic bearing of the seller, at the
left, is in pleasing contrast with the free and graceful carriage
of the well-bred buyer, to whom he is handing a sample of the
wine in a cup. At the right two servants are drawing another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
sample from an amphora; one tips the amphora so cautiously
that the other, who is holding the bowl, presses the neck gently
with his left hand in order to make the slender stream flow
faster.</p>

<p>Rapidity of movement reaches a climax in the middle picture
of the right wall, which represents the games of the Circus.
The scene is laid in the country; each goal is marked by three
trees. Antelopes take the place of horses, and the groups are
conceived with wonderful realism. The tiny, fluttering garments
of the drivers display the colors of the four parties,&mdash;green,
red, white, and blue.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 169. Cupids as dealers in wine.<br />
Wall painting in the house of the Vettii.</p>
</div>

<p>Two of the pictures on the end wall are so damaged that it is
not easy to make out the details. One of them, like that just
described, presents a purely Roman subject&mdash;the festival of
Vesta (<a href="#fig170">Fig. 170</a>). Cupids and Psyches are reclining at ease
about a serving table in the shape of a deep platter with two
handles, on which drinking vessels are seen; in the background
are two asses, sacred to Vesta (<a href="#Page_98">p. 98</a>). Some, at least, of the
Cupid pictures could not have been taken from Greek originals.</p>

<p>In the atrium also there was a black stripe containing Cupids
similar to those already described, but the figures are not so well
preserved. The most interesting scene represents a sacrifice to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
Fortuna. Cupids appear also riding and driving. Some are
mounted on goats and engaged in a contest. One stands on a
crab, guiding the ungainly creature with reins and plying the
whip; another is similarly mounted on a lobster. A few are in
chariots, the chariot in one case being drawn by two dolphins.</p>

<p>In each division of the wall of the atrium near the bottom is
the half-length figure of a child, painted on a dark red ground.
The children are busied with vessels of all kinds, apparently
intended for sacrifice. The seriousness of their task, the importance
which they attach to their helpfulness, is finely expressed
in the faces, which are individualized in the manner of a true
artist.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 170.&mdash;Cupids celebrating the festival of Vesta.<br />
Wall painting in the house of the Vettii.</p>
</div>

<p>We may dismiss the later paintings of the house with few
words. In the fauces (<i>b</i>) are small monochrome panels containing
a pair of deer, a cock fight, vases, and a wallet with a herald's
staff, attributes of Mercury, who perhaps had a place among
the Penates of the house.</p>

<p>In the room at the left of the atrium (<i>e</i>) is a painting of
Cyparissus, the youth beloved of Apollo, with his wounded deer
on the ground near him; in another part of the room is the
wrestling match between Pan and Eros. Among the figures
seen in the architectural framework of the upper division of the
wall is Zeus, sitting on his throne, represented as a youth, unbearded;
Leda with the swan also appears, and Danaë holding
out her robe to catch the golden rain.</p>

<p>The direction of the owner's tastes is perhaps indicated by a
painting in the peristyle, at the middle of the wall under the
colonnade at the left. It contains a portrait, probably of an
author; near by is a manuscript case with rolls of papyrus.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter p6"><a name="plate09" id="plate09"></a>
<img src="images/plate09.jpg" width="600" height="453" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PLATE IX.&mdash;A DINING ROOM IN THE HOUSE OF THE VETTII</p>
</div>

<p>The paintings in the two dining rooms opening on the peristyle,
<i>n</i> and <i>p</i>, are in a better state of preservation than those of
any other part of the house. In the first room, <i>n</i>, the simple
and restful decoration surrounding the large pictures is in striking
contrast with the pictures themselves, one of which is placed
at the middle of each of the three walls. Here we see the
infant Hercules strangling the serpents, there Pentheus and the
Maenads about to tear him in pieces; the subject of the third
painting is the punishment of Dirce, the treatment being not
unlike that of the sculptured Farnese group in the Naples
Museum.</p>

<p>The decorative effect of the other room, <i>p</i>, is more harmonious.
The divisions of the wall space, the relation of the three principal
paintings to the decorative design, and the distribution of
ornament are indicated in our illustration (<a href="#plate09">Plate IX</a>); but no
reproduction can do justice to the richness of the coloring.</p>

<p>The painting in the middle panel at the right brings before
us Bacchus with his train as they come upon the sleeping
Ariadne. On the left wall opposite is Daedalus, pointing out
the wooden cow that he has made to Pasiphae, who hands to
him a golden arm band. The subject of the third picture is
here met with for the first time at Pompeii&mdash;the punishment
of Ixion.</p>

<p>The tragedy of the scene (<a href="#fig171">Fig. 171</a>) is plainly suggested, but
not forced upon the beholder; we see, at the left, only half of
the ever revolving wheel to which the wretched victim is bound.
The other figures are more prominent and, with one exception,
convey no suggestion of pain or sympathy in either pose or
expression of face. Nearest the wheel is Hephaestus, who has
just fastened Ixion upon it; his pincers, hammer, and anvil are
lying upon the ground in the corner. In front of him is Hermes,
who, in obedience to the command of Zeus, brought the offender
to the place of punishment.</p>

<p>A sad-faced female figure with veiled head sits in the foreground&mdash;a
personification of the spirit of one who has died, a
shade introduced to indicate that the place of punishment is the
Underworld. The left hand is involuntarily raised with the
shock that the thought of the victim's suffering brings; the face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
has been thought by some to resemble that often given to the
Madonna.</p>

</div>

<p>The two figures at the right of the picture are of the upper
world, not directly connected with the main action, yet well conceived
and skilfully introduced. Nearer the foreground Hera
sits enthroned, her sceptre in her left hand; behind her stands
Iris, faithful messenger, who points out to her the well deserved
fate of him who dared to offer an affront to the queen of heaven.

<h3>CHAPTER XLII<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THREE HOUSES OF UNUSUAL PLAN</i></span></h3>

<p>In the houses described in the preceding chapters the distribution
of the rooms is characterized by a certain regularity,
which makes it possible to indicate the arrangements by reference
to an ideal or normal plan. A
wide departure, however, is occasionally
noted; and by way of illustration
three houses of unusual plan will be
briefly presented here, first a house
without an atrium, then one having
an atrium but no compluvium, and,
lastly, a large establishment built on
terraces at different levels.</p>

<h4>I. <span class="smcap">The House of Acceptus and
Euhodia</span></h4>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;"><a name="fig172" id="fig172"></a>

<ul class="cap-list">
<li><i>a.</i> Colonnade.</li>
<li><i>b.</i> Garden.</li>
<li><i>c.</i> Kitchen.</li>
<li><i>d.</i> Bedroom.</li>
<li><i>f.</i> Dining room.</li>
<li><i>g.</i> Garden.</li>
<li><i>i.</i> Bedroom with places for two beds.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Sometimes a few rooms of a large
house were cut off from the atrium
and used as a separate dwelling; the
original plan in such cases is easily
determined. The number of houses
built without an atrium in the beginning
is exceedingly small. Among
the pleasantest was the modest dwelling of Acceptus and Euhodia,
on the south side of the double Insula in the eighth
Region (VIII. v.-vi. 39); the names are taken from a couple
of election notices painted on the front, in which they appear
together.</p>

<p>From the street one passed directly under a colonnade
(<a href="#fig172">Fig. 172</a>, <i>a</i>) in two stories, facing a small garden (<i>b</i>), from which it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
was separated by a low wall. At one end of the garden was an
open-air triclinium (<i>k</i>), which still remains. The rest of the
plot, used as a flower garden, was profusely ornamented; five
heads of herms, a
frog and other objects
of marble were found
in it, besides a couple
of alabaster basins
and five statuettes of
Egyptian divinities
made of glazed pottery.
In the corner
of the colonnade, between
the garden and
the entrance, is a
small hearth, conveniently
placed for serving
the open-air triclinium; in the opposite corner at the left
the excavators found the remains of a cupboard, together with
vessels of bronze, glass, and clay. At the further end of the
colonnade one passed into another small garden (<i>g</i>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 340px;"><a name="fig173" id="fig173"></a>
<img src="images/fig173.jpg" width="340" height="234" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 173.&mdash;Longitudinal section of the house of Acceptus
and Euhodia, restored.<br />
<a href="images/fig173fs.jpg">View larger image</a></p>
</div>

<p>A bedroom (<i>d</i>) opened on the colonnade near the entrance.
A corridor (<i>e</i>) led to the kitchen (<i>c</i>) behind it. Beyond the
corridor is the dining room (<i>f</i>). Another sleeping room (<i>i</i>) with
places for two beds is entered through a kind of anteroom (<i>h</i>) at
the rear of the house.</p>

<p>The rooms of the second story corresponded closely with those
underneath, and were entered from the second story of the
colonnade; the stairs, partly of wood, started in the kitchen.
The appearance of the house as one looked from the garden at
the right toward the colonnade may be inferred from our restoration,
which gives a longitudinal section (<a href="#fig173">Fig. 173</a>); the letters
under the section refer to the rooms as they are indicated in the
plan.</p>

<p>The house was decorated in the fourth style. On the south
wall of the kitchen there is a painting of Fortuna, with the usual
attributes, a cornucopia and a rudder resting on a ball. The
Genius and the Lares nowhere appear, and as a lotus blossom is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
painted on the forehead of the goddess, who is thus conceived
of as a form of Isis, we may suppose that Acceptus and his wife
were adherents of the Egyptian cult. Besides the statuettes of
Egyptian divinities there was found in the garden the foot of a
marble table with a Greek inscription "of Serapion," an Egyptian
name. Acceptus and Euhodia may have come from Alexandria
and thence have introduced into Pompeii this type of house, so
unlike the native form. The Latin name of Acceptus does not
stand in the way of this explanation, for he was probably a
freedman, who in Egypt may have had a Roman master.</p>

<h4>II. <span class="smcap">A House without a Compluvium</span></h4>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig174" id="fig174"></a>
<img src="images/fig174.jpg" width="409" height="236" alt="" />

<li>2. Cistern curb.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The accompanying plan (<a href="#fig174">Fig. 174</a>) shows the arrangement of
a small house on the north side of Nola Street in the fifth
Region (V. v. 2). The problem of lighting the atrium (<i>e</i>), the
roof of which sloped toward the back, was met in a simple way.</p>

<p>At the rear a light court (<i>f</i>) was constructed, which furnished
light and air by means of broad windows, not only to the atrium,
but also to the adjoining room <i>g</i> and indirectly to the dining
room <i>k</i>, which had a window opening on <i>g</i>.</p>

<p>This arrangement, however, is in part the result of later
changes. Originally the room marked <i>g</i> belonged to the court,
<i>f</i>, and the house consisted of two parts, separated by a narrow
area. The kitchen was then in the low room (<i>i</i>) above which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
was a correspondingly low chamber, the height of the two rooms
being only equal to that of the dining room (<i>k</i>). In later times,
however, the hearth was moved to the
corner of the atrium (1), the smoke being
let out through a small window in
the wall. A stairway, partly of wood,
led to the upper rooms at the front of
the house. Along the street ran a stone
bench, protected by a roof projecting
over it.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;"><a name="fig175" id="fig175"></a>

</div>

<p>The water from the roofs fell into the
light court <i>f</i>, and was collected in a cistern.
We give a transverse section
across <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> (<a href="#fig175">Fig. 175</a>), showing the
arrangement of the roofs, doors, and
window at the rear.</p>

<p>On the wall of <i>g</i> is scratched the inscription,
<i>Fures foras, frugi intro</i>,&mdash;'Let thieves keep out, let
honest folk come in!'</p>

<h4>III. <span class="smcap">The House of the Emperor Joseph II</span></h4>

<p>A good example of a house extended over terraces at different
levels may be seen on the edge of the hill west of the Forum
Triangulare (VIII. ii. 39), that of the Emperor Joseph II, casa
dell' Imperatore Giuseppe II. The name was given in commemoration
of a visit of this emperor to Pompeii, in 1769, when
a special excavation in his honor was made in a part of the house.</p>

<p>The uppermost of the three terraces on which the house is
built (<a href="#fig176">Fig. 176</a>, 1) is at the level of the street (Vico della Regina,
<a href="#plan6">Plan VI</a>), the lowest (3) in part occupies the place of the old
city wall; the middle terrace is adjusted to the intervening slope.
The arrangement of the stairways between the terraces and the
distribution of the rooms may be more easily understood from
an inspection of the plan in connection with the key below than
from description.</p>

<p>There was a second story over a part of the rooms on the
upper terrace, as indicated by the stairways at <i>e</i> and <i>n</i> and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
the corner of <i>u</i>, but the extent of it is not easy to determine.
The traces of the upper rooms of the middle terrace, however,
are clearly seen, and their arrangement is indicated on the plan
(4); the height of θ and κ, which were in one story, was equal
to that of the smaller rooms with the chambers above.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The front of the house, the large Tuscan atrium with the
adjoining rooms, dates from the Tufa Period; the atrium was
originally one of the most richly decorated at Pompeii. The
rooms back of the atrium opening toward the rear, and those
of the middle and lower terraces, are a later addition, built after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
the city wall at this point had been removed, perhaps not long
before the end of the Republic; traces of the second style of
decoration are found in one of the lowest rooms, the tepidarium
of the bath. Remains of the first style are found in the fauces,
but the greater part of the house is decorated in the last style.</p>

<p>One of the small rooms (<i>c</i>) opening on the atrium, originally
a bedroom, was in later times turned into a house chapel. In
the right wall is a small niche, on the back of which a Genius
of the ordinary type is painted. Near him and also offering a
libation is a female figure with the attributes of Juno, a diadem,
and a sceptre. The two figures represent the Genii of the master
and mistress of the house (<a href="#Page_270">p. 270</a>). Under the niche, and at
the sides are iron nails, driven into the plaster to hold wreaths
and garlands.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 177.&mdash;Corner of bake room in the lowest story of the house of the Emperor
Joseph II, at the time of excavation.</p>
</div>

<p>On either side of the broad middle room (<i>w</i>) is a dining room
(<i>v</i>, <i>x</i>), connected with it by two large windows. All three rooms
open upon the colonnade (<i>y</i>), and this again opens out upon a
terrace (<i>z</i>).</p>

<p>The principal room of the middle story (2. η, under <i>z</i>) takes the
place of an atrium; it is lighted by a door and two windows
opening upon a terrace (μ). Connected with it are two dining
rooms (θ, κ), considerably higher than the other apartments of
this story, and three sleeping rooms (ι, λ, ζ). A dark corridor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
(β) separated these rooms from the solid earth at the rear, and
furnished access, by means of ladders, to two low upper rooms
(over ι and λ; see 4. <span class="s08">II</span>, <span class="s08">III</span>), perhaps used as storerooms.
From β one could also reach, in the same way, an oblong
chamber excavated in the earth (<span class="s08">I</span>), designed originally as a
cistern, but used as a cellar at the time of the eruption. Of the
remaining upper rooms one (<span class="s08">IV</span>) was built on the solid ground
at the side of the stairway leading from the upper floor (α);
the other two (<span class="s08">V</span>, over γ, δ and <span class="s08">VI</span>, over ζ) were connected by
a gallery or bridge over the stairway leading to the lower floor
(ε); this gallery could be reached also by a ladder or wooden
stairway in the large middle room (η). The outermost room
(<span class="s08">VI</span>) was perhaps a washroom; there is a rectangular basin in
one corner.</p>

<p>The lower floor was given up to a bath (<i>frigidarium</i>, 8; <i>tepidarium</i>,
6; <i>caldarium</i>, 7) and to a bakery (3, 4).</p>

<p>In the vaulted ceiling of the frigidarium (8) and one of the
rooms of the bakery (3) is a round hole for ventilation, opening
upon the terrace above through a kind of chimney. The hollow
walls of the caldarium (7) are carried to the crown of the
vault, at the middle of which is a similar opening for the vent.
The places of the three openings in the floor of the terrace are
seen in the plan (2, μ).</p>

<p>At one end of the larger room of the bakery (3) is the oven;
at the other two rectangular basins of masonry. In the corner
near the basins was found the skeleton of a man who at the
time of the eruption had taken refuge in this room and probably
died of hunger. The appearance of the room at the time of
excavation is shown in a sketch published by Mazois (<a href="#fig177">Fig. 177</a>).</p>

<p>The door near the corner, seen in the illustration, led outside
the city. The proprietor of the house perhaps had a special
permit enabling him to leave or enter the city at any time without
surveillance; none of the other houses along the edge of
the city have a private entrance of this kind.

<h3>CHAPTER XLIII<br />

<span class="s08"><i>OTHER NOTEWORTHY HOUSES</i></span></h3>

<p>The houses accorded a detailed description in the previous
chapters are few in comparison with the number of those
worthy of special study. He alone who has wandered day
after day among the ruins, returning again and again to explore
the parts of the city which are rarely seen by the hasty visitor,
can realize what a wealth of interesting material lies behind the
barren walls lining the streets on either side.</p>

<p>The location of the houses mentioned incidentally is given in
<a href="#plan6">Plan VI</a>, at the end of the volume. Such are, the house of
Caecilius Jucundus, on Stabian Street (V. i. 26), the tablinum of
which contains one of the most beautiful specimens of wall
decoration yet discovered, in the third style; the house of
Lucretius, on the same street (IX. iii. 5), with a little garden
behind the tablinum adorned with quaint sculptures; the house
of the Hunt on Nola Street (VII. iv. 48), so named from the
large hunting scene on the wall at the rear of the garden; and
further down on Nola Street (IX.  vii. 6) the extensive house
with three atriums and a large peristyle, excavated in 1879,
eighteen centuries after the destruction of the city, and hence
called the house of the Centenary, casa del Centenario.</p>

<p>In the same block with the house of the Hunt, opposite that
of the Faun, is the house of the Sculptured Capitals, casa dei
Capitelli Figurati (VII. iv. 57). It received its name from the
figures carved in the tufa capitals of the pilasters at the entrance,
one of which is shown in <a href="#fig178">Fig. 178</a>; the stucco with which the
surface was coated has now fallen off. Such figures are not
infrequently met with in pilaster capitals of the Tufa Period,
the subjects being always taken, as here, from the bacchic cycle;
the satyr at the left is well rendered. The plan of the house is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
simple, like that of other houses of moderate size dating from
the pre-Roman time.</p>

<p>Near the west end of Nola Street is the house of Pansa,
which occupies the whole of the sixth Insula of Region VI.
Although of approximately the
same size as the house of the
Faun, and built in the same
period, it contained fewer large
rooms; its proportions were
less impressive, its finish less
elegant. The walls present
many evidences of repairs and
alterations, but of the wall decoration
nothing remains.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 178.&mdash;Capital of pilaster at the entrance
of the house of the Sculptured Capitals.</p>
</div>

<p>The plan (<a href="#fig179">Fig. 179</a>) is of interest
on account of its regularity.
It well illustrates the extent to which, at Pompeii, rooms
not required for household purposes were utilized as shops and
small separate dwellings, which were rented to tenants, and
doubtless formed an important source of income.</p>

<p>The vestibule and fauces have been mentioned previously
(<a href="#Page_249">p. 249</a>). The living rooms are grouped about a single atrium
(2) and a large peristyle (9). A colonnade at the rear of the
house faces the garden, which, as indicated by the appearance
of the ground at the time of excavation, was used for vegetables.
Opening on the colonnade is the gardener's room (<i>a</i>).</p>

<p>In the front were shops, one of which (35) was connected
with the house and served as the proprietor's place of business;
another (33) was used as a salesroom for the bakery, which
occupied the rooms numbered 28-34. On the same side of
the house were three small two-story dwellings, one of which
(22-23) contained windows opening into an adjoining room (12)
of the house and into the peristyle; it was doubtless occupied
by some one connected with the household. The dwellings on
the other street (A, B, C) were larger. Fiorelli thought that
this Insula belonged to Alleius Nigidius Maius (<a href="#Page_489">p. 489</a>); the
name of Pansa was given to it from an election notice painted
on the front.

<p>There is a remarkable group of houses near the north end of
Mercury Street. The first in importance is the house of Castor
and Pollux (VI. ix. 6), which is so named from the figures of
the Dioscuri, holding their horses by the bridle, painted on the
walls of the principal fauces. Between the two atriums, one of
which is of the Corinthian type, lies a large peristyle; and behind
the Corinthian atrium is a garden with a colonnade in front.
The decoration of the house is especially effective; that of the
larger tablinum was by one of the best artists who worked at
Pompeii. The paintings in the two central panels of this room
are often mentioned; on the right wall, the recognition of
Achilles among the daughters of Lycomedes; on the left, the
quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon. The representation
of Venus Pompeiana shown in <a href="#fig004">Fig. 4</a> is from the peristyle.</p>

<p>Beyond the house of Castor and Pollux is that of the Centaur
(VI. ix. 3), which received its name from a painting in which
Hercules, Deianira, and Nessus appear; the end of a bedroom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
in this house is shown in <a href="#fig122">Fig. 122</a>. The rest of the insula
belongs to the large house of Meleager, named from a picture
representing Meleager and Atalanta. The walls contained numerous
mythological pictures, part of which were transferred to
the Naples Museum; those left on the walls have suffered from
exposure to the weather.</p>

<p>The house of Apollo also (VI. vii. 23), on the opposite side
of the street, is noteworthy on account of its decoration, in the
last style; the god appears in a series of paintings. Two
houses in the next insula, on the south, have in their gardens
fountain niches veneered with bright mosaics, the casa della
Fontana Grande (VI. viii. 22) and the casa della Fontana
Piccola (VI. viii. 23).</p>

house of the Anchor, restored.<br />
<a href="images/fig180fs.jpg">View larger image</a></p>
</div>

<p>At the middle of the tenth Insula, in the same Region, is the
house of the Anchor (VI. x. 7), so called from an anchor outlined
in the black and
white mosaic of the
fauces. The peristyle
here presents an interesting
peculiarity
of construction. The
level of the street at
the rear of the house
was below that of Mercury
Street. Instead
of filling up the lot so
as to raise the garden
to the height of the
front part, the builder
constructed a kind of basement under the colonnade of the peristyle,
the floor of which was thus adjusted to the level of the
floors in the front rooms; the garden and the floor of the basement
were on the same level as the street at the rear. The
colonnade was higher on the north than on the other three
sides (<a href="#fig180">Fig. 180</a>). The effect of the whole was far from unpleasing.
Whether the projections seen in the niches below, at
the level of the garden, are pedestals or small altars cannot be
determined. The niches at the front end were made larger, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
were three in number. In the middle niche was a diminutive
temple; the other two had the form of an apse, and contained
fountain figures.</p>

<p>Houses were sometimes enlarged at the expense of neighboring
dwellings, which, in some cases, were destroyed to the
foundations, in others remodelled or incorporated with slight
change. An example is the house of the Citharist, which fills
the greater part of the fourth Insula in Region I, on the east
side of Stabian Street. A bronze statue of Apollo playing the
cithara, found in the middle peristyle (<a href="#fig181">Fig. 181</a>, 17), gave its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
name to the house. It is apparently a faithful copy of a Greek
masterpiece at Sparta, and is now in the Naples Museum. The
house is sometimes referred to as that of Popidius Secundus.</p>

Wall painting from the house of the Citharist.</p>
</div>

<p>There are two atriums (6, 47) and three peristyles (17, 32, 56).
A large part of the house, the west atrium (6), with the connecting
rooms and the two peristyles, 17 and 32, was built in the
Tufa Period, in the place of several older houses. The rooms
east of the two peristyles, and the north atrium (47) and peristyle
(56), with the adjoining rooms, were added in Roman times,
probably near the end of the Republic; the house was afterwards
decorated in the second style. Remains of the third and fourth
styles also are found in some parts of the house. The better
apartments are grouped about the peristyles; the rooms about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
the atriums were turned over to the slaves or used for domestic
purposes.</p>

<p>In the large room (35) opening on the south peristyle were two
paintings of unusual merit, both of which were transferred to the
Naples Museum. The subject of one was the finding of the
deserted Ariadne by Bacchus; in the other Orestes and Pylades
appear as captives before Thoas, the king of Tauris (<a href="#fig182">Fig. 182</a>).</p>

<p>At the right of the picture sits Thoas, looking at the captives,
his sword lying across his knees, his hands resting upon the end
of his sceptre. Behind him stands a guard with a long spear in
the right hand. Another guard with two spears stands behind
Orestes and Pylades, whose hands are bound. Orestes, upon
whose head is a wreath of laurel, looks downward, an expression
of sadness and resignation upon his finely chiselled features.
Pylades is not without anxiety, but is alert and hopeful.
Between the two groups is an altar on which incense is
burning. In the background Iphigenia is seen moving slowly
forward; the head is entirely obliterated. It is unfortunate
that the painting is so badly preserved. The faces of the two
youths are individualized with remarkable skill, and the picture
here used as the centre of a decorative framework of the fourth
style is evidently a copy of a masterpiece.</p>

<p>On the south side of Abbondanza Street, opposite the Stabian
Baths, is the house of Cornelius Rufus (VIII. iv. 15), a view of
the interior of which has already been given. The name of the
proprietor is known from the dedication on the herm (seen in
<a href="#fig121">Fig. 121</a>), <i>C. Cornelio Rufo</i>; the carved table supports behind
the impluvium are among the finest yet discovered.</p>

<p>In the same block is the house of Marcus Holconius (VIII.
iv. 4), a good example of a house completely restored and decorated
after the earthquake of 63. The right ala was fitted up
with shelves, on which at the time of the eruption were kitchen
vessels of bronze, iron, and terra cotta. The colonnade about
the peristyle was in two stories. From the columns at the front
six jets of water, at a height of about four feet, fell forward into
the gutter; and there was an equal number at the rear. There
was also a little fountain in the exedra at the rear of the peristyle.

<h3>CHAPTER XLIV<br />

<span class="s08"><i>ROMAN VILLAS.&mdash;THE VILLA OF DIOMEDES</i></span></h3>

<p>Two classes of villas were distinguished by the Romans,&mdash;the
country seat, <i>villa pseudourbana</i>, and the farmhouse, <i>villa rustica</i>.
The former was a city house, adapted to rural conditions;
the arrangements of the latter were determined by the requirements
of farm life.</p>

<p>The country seats manifested a greater diversity of plan than
the city residences. They were relatively larger, containing
spacious colonnades and gardens; as the proprietor was unrestricted
in regard to space, not being confined to the limits
of a lot, fuller opportunity was afforded for the display of individual
taste in the arrangement of rooms. We can understand
from the letters of Pliny the Younger, describing his two villas
at Laurentum and Tifernum Tiberinum (now Città di Castello),
and from the remains of the villa of Hadrian at Tivoli, how far
individuality might assert itself in the planning and building of
a country home.</p>

<p>The main entrance of a country seat, according to Vitruvius,
should lead directly to a peristyle; one or more atriums might
be placed further back. The living rooms would be grouped
about the central spaces in the way that would best suit the
configuration of the ground and meet the wishes of the owner.
In farmhouses there would naturally be a court near the entrance;
and the hearth, as we have seen, down to the latest
times, was placed in the room that corresponded with the atrium
of the city house. In most parts of Italy a large farmhouse
would contain appliances for making wine and oil.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the two types of country house in the
vicinity of Pompeii may be briefly illustrated by reference to
an example of each, the villa of Diomedes and the farmhouse
recently excavated at Boscoreale.

</div>

<p>The location of the villa of Diomedes, beyond the last group
of tombs at the left
of the road leading
from the Herculaneum
Gate, is
indicated in <a href="#plan5">Plan V</a>.
An extensive establishment
similar in
character, the so-called
villa of Cicero,
lies nearer the
Gate on the same
side of the road;
on the right there
is a third villa, of
which only a small
part has been uncovered.
The
three seem to have
belonged to a series
of country seats situated
on the ridge
that extends back
from Pompeii in
the direction of Vesuvius. The villa
of Diomedes, excavated
in 1771-74,
received its name
from the tomb of
Marcus Arrius Diomedes,
facing the
entrance, on the
opposite side of
the Street of Tombs
(<a href="#plan5">Plan V</a>, 42).</p>

<p>The front of the
villa forms a sharp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
angle with the street. The orientation of the building was determined
by an abrupt descent in the ground, which runs across
the middle and divides it into two parts. The front part, the
rooms of which are numbered on the plan (<a href="#fig183">Fig. 183</a>), is a few
feet above the level of the street at the entrance. The rear portion,
as may be seen from our section (<a href="#fig184">Fig. 184</a>), is considerably
lower; on the plan the rooms of this portion are designated by
letters. From traces of the second style of decoration found in
two of the rooms, and from the character of the masonry, we
infer that the villa was built in Roman times, but before the
reign of Augustus.</p>

<p>In front of the door was a narrow porch (<a href="#fig184">Fig. 184</a>). The
door opened directly into the peristyle (3 on the plan), in the
middle of which was a garden. At the left is a small triangular
court (17) containing a swimming tank (ζ) and a hearth (ε) on
which a kettle and several pots were found; the Romans partook
of warm refreshments after a bath. The wall back of the
swimming tank was in part decorated with a garden scene, not
unlike those in the frigidariums of the two older public baths.
Over the tank was a roof supported by two columns, and on the
other two sides of the court there was a low but well proportioned
colonnade.</p>

<p>The arrangements of the bath were unusually complete, comprising
an apodyterium (19), a tepidarium (20), and a caldarium
(21), from which the tepidarium was warmed by means of an
opening in the wall; the caldarium had a hollow floor and walls,
and was heated from the kitchen (22). In the tepidarium were
found four panes of glass about 10½ inches square, together
with the remains of the wooden frame in which they were set.
The caldarium, like those of the public baths, had a bath basin
and a semicircular niche for the labrum.</p>

<p>A small oven stands on one end of the hearth in the kitchen,
and a stone table is built against the wall on the long side. The
room in the corner (23) was used as a reservoir for water, which
was brought into it by means of a feed pipe and thence distributed
through smaller pipes leading to the bath rooms and other
parts of the house.</p>

<p>At the left of the peristyle is a passage (15) leading to a garden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
which has not yet been excavated. The only apartment of
special interest in this portion of the house is the semicircular
sleeping room (14) built out into the garden. It faced the south,
and had three large windows; it was separated from the rest of
the house by an anteroom, <i>procoeton</i> (13), at one end of which
is a small division (β) designed for the bed of an attendant. In
the semicircular room are an alcove for a bed (γ) and a stationary
wash bowl of masonry (δ). The plan is similar to that of a
bedroom in Pliny's villa at Laurentum. Another sleeping room
(9) was provided with both a large and a small door (<a href="#Page_261">p. 261</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>The large room (8) at the rear of the peristyle may be loosely
called a tablinum; it could be closed at the rear. Back of the
tablinum was originally a colonnade (26), which was later turned
into a corridor, with rooms at either end; the original form is
assumed in our restoration. Beyond the colonnade was a broad
terrace (28) extending to the edge of the garden. It commanded
a magnificent view of Stabiae, the coast in the direction of
Sorrento, and the Bay. Connected with it was an unroofed
promenade over the colonnade (<i>e, f, g, h</i>) surrounding the large
garden below. A rectangular room (27, indicated on the plan
but not in the restoration) was afterwards built on the terrace.</p>

<p>Members of the family could pass into the lower portion of
the villa by means of a stairway, at <i>b</i>; the slaves could use a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
long corridor (<i>a</i>), which was more directly connected with the
domestic apartments. The flat roof of the quadrangular colonnade
(<i>e, f, g, h</i>) was carried on the outside by a wall, on the
inside by square pillars (<a href="#fig184">Fig. 184</a>). The rooms (<i>i</i>, <i>k</i>) opening
into the front of the colonnade were vaulted, and the decoration,
in the last style, is well preserved; the ceiling of the corner
rooms (<i>l</i>, <i>m</i>) is flat, and the decoration of one of them (<i>l</i>) is
noteworthy; green and red stars are painted on a white ground.
In the narrow space between <i>i</i> and <i>c</i> a cistern was built, from
which water could be drawn by means of a faucet in front.</p>

<p>At the opposite corners of the colonnade were two airy garden
rooms (<i>n</i>, <i>o</i>). Outside of the left arm (<i>e, f</i>) was a broad walk
(<i>u</i>), at the upper end of which were steps leading to the garden
above.</p>

<p>The garden enclosed by the colonnade was planted with trees,
charred remains of which were found at the time of excavation.
In the middle was a fish pond (<i>r</i>), in which was a fountain.
Back of it was a platform, over which vines were trained on a
framework supported by six columns, making a pleasant arbor
in which meals were doubtless often served.</p>

<p>The door at the rear of the garden led into the fields. Near
it were found the skeletons of two men. One of them had a
large key, doubtless the key of this door; he wore a gold ring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
on his finger, and was carrying a considerable sum of money&mdash;ten
gold and eighty-eight silver coins. He was probably the
master of the house who had started out, accompanied by a
single slave, in order to find means of escape.</p>

<p>The floor of the three sides of the colonnade was a few feet
higher than that of the front. Underneath was a wine cellar,
lighted by small windows in the wall on the side of the garden;
it contained a large number of amphorae.</p>

<p>At the time of the eruption many members of the family
took refuge in the cellar. Here were found the skeletons of
eighteen adults and two children: at the time of excavation the
impressions of their bodies, and in some instances traces of
the clothing, could be seen in the hardened ashes. Among the
women was one adorned with two necklaces and two arm bands,
besides four gold rings and two of silver. The victims were
suffocated by the damp ashes that drifted in through the small
windows. According to the report of the excavations, fourteen
skeletons of men were found in other parts of the house, together
with the skeletons of a dog and a goat.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLV<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE VILLA RUSTICA AT BOSCOREALE</i></span></h3>

<p>Less than two miles north of Pompeii, near the village of Boscoreale,
a farmhouse was excavated in 1893-94 on the property
of Vincenzo de Prisco. In the last century similar buildings
were brought to light in the vicinity of Castellammare, but they
were covered up again. Especial importance attaches to this
villa rustica, both on account of the extreme rarity of examples
of the type and because of the character of the remains,
which makes it possible to determine the arrangements with
certainty.</p>

<p>The living rooms, the stable, and the rooms used for the
making of wine and oil were all under one roof. The size of
the building is not so great as might have been assumed from
the variety of purposes which it served; the enclosed area,
exclusive of the threshing floor, measures about 130 by 82 feet.
The plan (<a href="#plan4">Plan IV</a>) is regular, the principal entrance being near
the middle of the southwest side.</p>

<p>The entrance was wide enough for carts and wagons, which
were kept in the court (<i>A</i>). Along three sides of the court ran
a colonnade, over which at the front were upper rooms; the
roof on the left side and the rear rested on columns connected
by a parapet. Under the colonnade at the further corner is a
cistern curb (1), on one side of which is a large wash basin of
masonry (2); on the other is a pillar supporting a small reservoir
of lead (3). The reservoir, reached by means of steps (4), was
filled from the cistern.</p>

<p>In a Roman farmhouse the kitchen was the large, central
room (<a href="#Page_253">p. 253</a>). Vitruvius recommends that it be placed on the
warmest side of the court; and in our villa rustica it lies at the
north corner (<i>B</i>) where, in winter, it would receive the full
benefit of the sunshine. The hearth (1), on which remains of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
fire were found, stands in the middle of the room; in the wall
at the rear is a niche, ornamented to resemble the façade of a
diminutive temple, in which were placed the images of the
household gods.</p>

<p>A large door in the right wall of the kitchen opened into the
stable (<i>H</i>). Near it was a stairway (3) leading to upper rooms;
in the corner was a pit (4) affording access to a small cellar in
which the standard of the press beam in the adjoining room
(<i>P</i>, 4) was made fast. In the opposite corner was a reservoir
of lead (2) standing on a foundation of masonry; it received
water from the reservoir in the court (<i>A</i>, 3) and supplied the
bath. On the same side of the room is the entrance to the bath
and to the closet (<i>G</i>).</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 185.&mdash;Hot water tank and reservoir for supplying
the bath in the villa rustica at Boscoreale.<br />
<a href="images/fig185fs.jpg">View larger image</a></p>
</div>

<p>The arrangements of this bath are in a better state of preservation
than those of any other Roman bath yet discovered; the
tank and reservoir with
the connecting pipes
may now be seen at
Pompeii in the little
Museum near the Forum
fitted up for the exhibition
of the objects
found in this villa. The
bath rooms comprised
an apodyterium (<i>D</i>),
a tepidarium (<i>E</i>), and
a caldarium (<i>F</i>) with a
bath basin at one end
and a labrum in a semicircular
recess at the other. The bath was heated from a small
furnace room (<i>C</i>). Over the hot air flue leading from the furnace
into the hollow space under the floor of the caldarium was
a water heater in the form of a half cylinder similar to the one
found in the Stabian Baths (<a href="#Page_194">p. 194</a>). The tepidarium, as well
as the caldarium, had a hollow floor and walls.</p>

<p>Over the furnace stood a round lead tank, the lower part of
which was encased in masonry; the pipes connecting it with
the reservoir in the corner of the kitchen and with the bath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
rooms were found in place, and are shown in <a href="#fig185">Fig. 185</a>. The
middle pipe supplied the tank with cold water; the flow could
be regulated by means of a stopcock. The lower pipe started
from the reservoir, but before reaching the tank was divided,
the left arm leading into the tank, the other into the bath basin.
As there were stopcocks in the main pipe and in the arm
entering the tank, by adjusting these the bath basin could be
supplied with either hot or cold water through a single pipe.
The upper pipe was divided in the same way, one arm leading
to the labrum. In the public baths there was a separate tank
for lukewarm water; here a moderate temperature was obtained
by mixing hot and cold water.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the tank (seen at the right) is a short bibcock
used when the water was drawn off. On the side of the
reservoir we see the end of the feed pipe leading from the
reservoir in the court; at the right is a supply pipe which conducted
to the stable (<i>H</i>) water not needed for the bath.</p>

<p>On the same side of the court is a tool room (<i>J</i>), in which
were found remains of tools; several sickles were hanging on
the walls. Next are two sleeping rooms (<i>K</i>, <i>L</i>); a passage
between them leads to the bakery, with a single mill (1) and
oven (2). In the corner is a dining room (<i>N</i>) in which the
remains of three couches were found; it was separated from the
court by an anteroom (<i>M</i>).</p>

<p>Over the colonnade on the front side of the court was a sleeping
room with a large room adjoining, perhaps the bedroom of
the overseer, <i>villicus</i>, which, according to Varro should be near
the entrance.</p>

<p>The oblong room at the northeast side of the court contained
appliances for making wine. At each end was a large press
with a raised floor (<i>forum</i>, 1). The presses were operated on
the same principle as that previously described (<a href="#Page_336">p. 336</a>, <a href="#fig168">Fig. 168</a>).</p>

<p>At the rear of each press was a strong standard (<i>arbor</i>, 4), to
which the inner end of the press beam (<i>prelum</i>) was attached.
In front stood two posts (<i>stipites</i>, 5-5), to which were fitted the
ends of a horizontal windlass. By means of a pulley and a rope
passed around the windlass, the outer end of the press beam
could be raised or lowered. When it was lowered in order to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
increase the pressure on the grapes, both standard and windlass
posts would be pulled out of the ground unless firmly braced.
Under the rear of each press was a small cellar, in which was
placed a framework for holding the standard in place. One
was entered from a pit in the corner of the kitchen (<i>B</i>, 4), the
other from a similar depression in a small separate room (<i>W</i>);
at 6 was a pit for fastening the windlass posts.</p>

<p>The grape juice ran into round vats (2, 2) sunk in the ground.
In front of the first press are two, in front of the second only
one; a cistern of which the curb (3) is indicated on the plan,
here takes the place of the other vat. The cistern could be filled
also from the first press by means of a lead pipe under the floor.
The round vats were for the pure juice of the first pressing.
Into the other was conducted the product of the second pressing;
the remains of the grapes, after the juice had ceased to
flow, were drenched with water and again subjected to pressure.</p>

<p>In Pliny's "Natural History" (XIV. xxi. 136) we read that in
Campania the best wine underwent fermentation in the open air,
exposed to sun, rain, and wind. This villa supplies an interesting
confirmation of the statement; the round fermentation vats
fill a large court (<i>R</i>), the walls of which are pierced with openings
in order to give readier access to the wind. Along one side
runs a channel of masonry about three feet above the ground (1),
protected by a narrow roof; thence the grape juice was distributed
through lead pipes to the vats. During the vintage season,
the inner end of the channel was connected with the press room
by means of a temporary pipe or channel entering the wall above
the cistern (<i>P</i>, 3).</p>

<p>The surface of this court is higher than that of the rest of the
building; instead of excavating in order to set the large earthen
vats in the ground, the proprietor filled in with earth around
them. In one corner is a lead kettle (3) with a place for building
a fire underneath; perhaps wine was heated in it. The vats in
the court seem not to have been used exclusively for wine. In
one were found remains of wheat, in another of millet. Other
vats stood in the passageway on the side of the court (<i>Q</i>, 1).</p>

<p>Three of the small rooms toward the rear were sleeping rooms
(<i>V-V</i>). In another (<i>X</i>) was found a hand mill. At the end of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
the passageway was a double room containing the appliances
for making oil, a press (in <i>Y</i>) and a crusher (in <i>Z</i>). The press
was like the wine press described above, only much smaller, with
a raised floor (1), a standard for the press beam (2), a pit for
bracing the standard of the press beam (3), two posts at the
ends of the windlass (4, 4), a pit from which a crosspiece connecting
these posts could be reached, and a vat (6) at one side
for receiving the oil. This vat, for some reason not understood,
was divided into two parts by a partition in the middle.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 186.&mdash;Olive crusher.</p>
</div>

<p>The olive crusher, <i>trapetum</i>, now in the Museum at Pompeii
mentioned above, is shown in the accompanying illustration
(<a href="#fig186">Fig. 186</a>). It was designed to separate the pulp of the olives
from the stones, which were thought to impair the flavor of the
oil. It consists of a deep circular basin of lava, so hollowed
out as to leave in the centre a strong standard of the stone,
<i>miliarium</i>. In the top of this standard was set an iron pin,
on which was fitted a revolving wooden crosspiece (shown in
<a href="#fig186">Fig. 186</a>, restored). This carried two wheels of lava, having the
shape of half a lens, which travelled in the basin. The wheels
were carefully balanced so that they would not press against
the side of the basin and crush the stones of the olives.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span></p>

<p>In the long room <i>S</i> remains of bean straw and parts of a
wagon were found. South of it is the threshing floor (<i>T</i>), the
surface of which is raised above the ground and covered with
Signia pavement. The water that fell upon the threshing floor
was conducted to a small open cistern (<i>U</i>).</p>

<p>For at least a part of the year the proprietor of the villa
probably lived in it. So elaborate a bath would not have been
built for the use of slaves; and in the second story was a modest
but comfortable series of apartments (over <i>V</i>, <i>W</i>, <i>X</i>, and part
of <i>Q</i>), apparently designed for the master's use, as was also the
dining room (<i>N</i>) with <i>K</i> and <i>L</i>.</p>

<p>In a place where such a find would least have been anticipated&mdash;the
cistern in the room of the wine presses&mdash;was made
a remarkable discovery of treasure. Here a man had taken
refuge, and with his skeleton were found about a thousand gold
coins, four gold bracelets, ear-rings, a gold chain, and the beautiful
collection of silver ware (<a href="#Page_380">p. 380</a>) afterwards presented by
Baron Rothschild to the Louvre.

<h3>CHAPTER XLVI<br />

<span class="s08"><i>HOUSEHOLD FURNITURE</i></span></h3>

<p>Much less large furniture has been found at Pompeii than is
ordinarily supposed. In not a single sleeping room has a bed
been preserved; and in only one of all the dining rooms have
sufficient remains of the dining couches been found to make it
possible to reconstruct them. Beds, couches, chairs, and tables
were ordinarily of wood, which crumbled away, leaving slight
traces. Reference has been made elsewhere to the marble
tables standing in the atrium, and occasionally in other parts of
the house. Tables of bronze are infrequently met with, while
bronze chairs are almost as rare as bronze couches.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig188" id="fig188"></a>
<img src="images/fig188.jpg" width="553" height="357" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 188.&mdash;Dining couch with bronze mountings, the wooden frame being restored.</p>
</div>

<p>Wood was not a suitable material for many classes of smaller
articles, and these, made of bronze, clay, glass, or stone, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
found in great numbers. Such are the lamps, the bronze lamp
stands, the kitchen utensils, the table furnishings, and the toilet
articles of bronze, ivory, or bone.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 310px;"><a name="fig189" id="fig189"></a>
<img src="images/fig189.jpg" width="309" height="213" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 189.&mdash;Round marble table.</p>
</div>

<p>The wooden frame and end board of one of the dining couches
just mentioned was completely charred, but the form was clearly
indicated, and the woodwork
has been restored
(<a href="#fig188">Fig. 188</a>). The couch
is now in the Naples
Museum, as are also the
other articles of furniture
illustrated in this chapter.</p>

<p>The half figures on the
front of the end board,
shown more plainly in the
detail at the left of the
illustration, were cast;
the rest of the mounting was <i>repoussé</i> work. The bronze on the
side toward the table was inlaid with silver. The end boards
were placed at the head of the upper
couch and the foot of the lower
one (<a href="#Page_263">p. 263</a>); the middle couch
did not have a raised end. The
mattress rested on straps stretched
across the frame. The dining
room in which the couches were
found adjoins the tablinum of a
house in the seventh Region (VII.
ii. 18).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 226px;"><a name="fig190" id="fig190"></a>
<img src="images/fig190.jpg" width="226" height="211" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 190.&mdash;Carved table leg, found in
the second peristyle of the house
of the Faun.</p>
</div>

<p>The carved marble supports of
a gartibulum are shown in
<a href="#fig121">Fig. 121</a>; a complete table of a plainer
type is seen in <a href="#plate07">Plate VII</a>. An example of a round marble table,
found in 1827 in a house near the Forum, is presented in
<a href="#fig189">Fig. 189</a>. The three legs are carved to represent those of lions, a
lion's head being placed at the top of each. A table of similar
design was found in the peristyle of the house of the Vettii,
with traces of yellow color on the manes of the lions (<a href="#Page_326">p. 326</a>).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span></p>

<p>Among the best examples of ornamental carving is the marble
table leg in the form of a sphinx, found in the second peristyle
of the house of the Faun (<a href="#fig190">Fig. 190</a>). Effective also is the bold
carving of the gartibulum in the north atrium of the house of
Siricus (VII. i. 25).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;"><a name="fig191" id="fig191"></a>
<img src="images/fig191.jpg" width="348" height="587" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 191.&mdash;Bronze stand with an ornamented rim around
the top.</p>
</div>

<p>Small tables or stands of bronze supported by three slender
legs were called tripods.
The top was
flat, but not infrequently
surrounded by
a deep rim, making a
convenient receptacle
for light objects. The
rim of the example
shown in <a href="#fig191">Fig. 191</a> is
ornamented with festoons
and bucrania,
while the upper parts
of the legs are modelled
to represent winged
sphinxes. This stand
was not found in the
temple of Isis, as is
often stated, but probably
in Herculaneum.</p>

<p>The bisellium, the
'seat of double width,'
was a chair of simple
design without a back,
used in the Theatre and
Amphitheatre by members
of the city council
and others upon whom
the "honor of the bisellium"
had been conferred.
The remains of one with bronze mountings have been
restored. The restoration, however, does not seem to be correct
in all particulars, and instead of presenting it we may refer the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
reader to the somewhat conventional bisellium carved on the
tomb of Calventius Quietus (<a href="#fig242">Fig. 242</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 305px;"><a name="fig192" id="fig192"></a>
<img src="images/fig192.jpg" width="304" height="122" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 192.&mdash;Lamps of the simplest form, with one
nozzle.</p>
</div>

<p>The&nbsp;lamps are found in a great variety of forms. The essential
parts are the body, containing the oil, which was poured in
through an opening in the
top, and the nozzle with
a hole for the wick
(<a href="#fig192">Fig. 192</a>). Hand lamps were
usually provided with a
handle, hanging lamps
with projections containing
holes through which
the chains could be passed.</p>

<p>The opening for the admission of oil was often closed by an
ornamental cover (<a href="#fig195">Figs. 195</a>, <a href="#fig196">196</a>). In front of it, near the base
of the nozzle, was frequently a much smaller orifice through
which a large needle could be inserted to pick up the wick when
it had burned out and
sunk back into the oil,
and air could be admitted
when the cover was
closed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 315px;"><a name="fig193" id="fig193"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 193.&mdash;Lamps with two nozzles.
At the left, a hanging lamp; at the right, a hand lamp.</p>
</div>

<p>The material of the
lamps was clay or bronze.
The bronze lamps were
more costly and ordinarily
more freely ornamented.
Those of clay were left
unglazed, or covered with a red glazing like that of the Arretian
ware; lamps with a greenish glaze are occasionally found.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig194" id="fig194"></a>
<img src="images/fig194.jpg" width="534" height="100" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 194.&mdash;Lamps with more than two nozzles.</p>
</div>

<p>The light furnished by the wicks was dim and smoky. A
more brilliant light was obtained by increasing the number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
nozzles. Lamps with two nozzles are often found. These were
sometimes placed at one end, the handle being at the other;
sometimes in the case of hanging lamps, at opposite ends, as in
the example shown in <a href="#fig193">Fig. 193</a>.</p>

<p>Lamps with several nozzles are not infrequently met with.
The shape is often circular, as in two of the examples presented
in <a href="#fig194">Fig. 194</a>, one of
which had six wicks, the other
twelve. Sometimes a more
ornamental form was adopted.
Lamps having the shape of a
boat are not uncommon; the
one represented in <a href="#fig194">Fig. 194</a>
was provided with nozzles for fourteen wicks.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 275px;"><a name="fig195" id="fig195"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 195.&mdash;Bronze lamps with ornamental
covers attached to a chain.</p>
</div>

<p>The hanging lamps were sometimes made with a single nozzle,
as the curious one having the shape of a mask shown in <a href="#fig197">Fig. 197</a>,
at the left; sometimes with two nozzles (<a href="#fig193">Fig. 193</a>). Bronze
hanging lamps with three arms, each of which contained a place
for a wick, are occasionally
found; an example
is given in
<a href="#fig197">Fig. 197</a>, at the right. Still
more elaborate are
those with a large number
of nozzles, as the
one represented in the
same illustration, which
had nine wicks.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 335px;"><a name="fig196" id="fig196"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 196.&mdash;Bronze lamps with covers ornamented with
figures.</p>
</div>

<p>The name of the
maker is often stamped
upon the bottom of the lamp, sometimes in the nominative case,
as <span class="smcap">Pulcher</span>, in the example given in <a href="#fig192">Fig. 192</a>, more often in the
genitive and in an abbreviated form.</p>

<p>The variety displayed in the ornamentation of lamps was as
great as that manifested in the forms. Ornament was applied to
all parts,&mdash;the body, the handle, the cover, and even the nozzle.
The covers of the two bronze lamps shown in <a href="#fig196">Fig. 196</a> are
adorned with figures. On one is a Cupid struggling with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
goose. The chain attached to the right hand of the figure on
the other is fastened to a hooked needle for pulling out the
wick.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 197.&mdash;Three hanging lamps.

</div>

<p>The object of which we give a representation in <a href="#fig198">Fig. 198</a>,
often erroneously classed as a lamp, is a nursing bottle, <i>biberon</i>.
The material is clay, and the figure of a gladiator is stamped on
it, symbolizing the hope that the infant will develop strength
and vigor. On some bottles of this kind the figure of a thriving
child is seen, on others a mother suckling a child.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 198.&mdash;A nursing

</div>

<p>Three kinds of supports for lamps may be distinguished according
to their size: lamp standards, which
stood on the floor and ranged in height from
2½ to 5 feet; lamp holders, not far from 20
inches high, which were placed on tables; and
small lamp stands, also used on the table.
The general term <i>candelabrum</i> was originally
applied to candle holders containing several
candles (<i>candelae</i>). Such candle holders have
been found in Etruscan graves, but the candelabra
met with at Pompeii were all designed to carry lamps.</p>

<p>The lamp standards, of bronze, are often of graceful proportions
and ornamented in good taste. The feet are modelled to
represent the claws (<a href="#fig199">Fig. 199</a>) or hoofs of animals. The slender
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
shaft rises sometimes directly from the union of the three legs
at the centre, sometimes from a round, ornamented disk resting
on the legs. Above the shaft is usually an ornamental form, a
sphinx, as in our illustration, a head,
or a vase-like capital sustaining the
round flat top on which the lamp
rested. Occasionally the shaft is replaced
by a conventional plant form.</p>

<p>Adjustable standards also occur;
the upper part slides up and down in
the hollow shaft of the lower part,
so that the height can be changed
at will.</p>

<p>The bronze lamp holders were
sometimes designed to support a
single lamp (<a href="#fig200">Fig. 200</a>). Frequently
the main part divides into two
branches, each of which sustains a
small round disk for a lamp; often
the arms or branches were designed
to carry hanging lamps. The example
shown in <a href="#fig201">Fig. 201</a> is from the
villa of Diomedes.</p>

<p>In the lamp holders conventional
plant forms are more frequently met
with than in the standards. The
trunk of a tree with spreading
branches is especially common
(<a href="#fig202">Fig. 202</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 185px;"><a name="fig199" id="fig199"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 199.&mdash;Lamp standard, of bronze.</p>
</div>

<p>The lamp stands, which resemble
diminutive bronze tables, are found
in a pleasing variety of form and ornament.
The top is sometimes a
round disk resting on a single leg
supported by three feet; sometimes,
as in the example presented in
<a href="#fig203">Fig. 203</a>, the legs are carried to the
top, and the intervening spaces are utilized for ornamentation.

<p>Kitchen utensils of bronze and red earthenware have been
found in great quantity; table furnishings more rarely. A
group of typical examples is presented in <a href="#fig204">Fig. 204</a>. The forms
are so similar to those of the utensils found in modern households
that few words of explanation are needed.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p>The pastry mould (<i>s</i>) is of good size and neatly finished, and
must have left a clear impression. Besides the two types of
table spoons illustrated here (<i>n, v</i>) a third is represented by examples
found at Pompeii, the <i>cochlear</i>, which had a bowl at one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
end and ran out into a point at the other. The point was
used in picking shellfish out of their shells, the bowl in eating
eggs.</p>

<p>The two long ladles were used in dipping wine out of the
mixing bowl into the cups. The ancients ordinarily drank their
wine mingled with water; for mixing the
liquids they used a large bowl of earthenware
or metal, which was often richly
ornamented. The mixing bowl presented
in <a href="#fig205">Fig. 205</a> was found in a house
on Abbondanza Street, near the entrance
of the building of Eumachia. It
is in part inlaid with silver, and nearly
twenty-two inches high.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 205.&mdash;Mixing bowl, of bronze

</div>

<p>Hot water was often preferred for
mixing with wine, and small heaters
of ornamental design were sometimes
used upon the table. The ancient
name for these utensils is <i>authepsa</i>,
'self-cooker'; the appropriateness of
it is apparent from an example found
at Pompeii, in which the coals of fire were entirely concealed
from view.</p>

is a tube, the bottom of which is closed by a diminutive
grate; the arrangement is shown in the section at the right.
In this tube the coals were placed, and when the water in the
urn was hot, it could be drawn off by means of a faucet at the
side. Back of the faucet is a small vertical vent tube.</p>

<p>In some cases the appearance of a heater was more suggestive
of its purpose. One (<a href="#fig207">Fig. 207</a>) has the form of an ordinary
brazier, the water being heated in the hollow space about the
fire pan. In another instance (<a href="#fig208">Fig. 208</a>) the brazier is ornamented
with towers and battlements like those of a diminutive
fortress; the faucet can be seen in our illustration, on the
left side.</p>

<p>An interesting group of toilet appliances for the bath was
found in the Baths north of the Forum (<a href="#fig209">Fig. 209</a>). Hanging
from a ring were an unguent flask, four scrapers (<i>strigiles</i>), and
a shallow saucer with a handle in which the unguent was poured
out when it was to be applied. One of the scrapers is repeated
in a side view at the right, and both side and front views of the
unguent saucer are given.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span></p>

<p>Small articles of toilet are discovered in a good state of
preservation. The forms in most cases do not differ greatly
from those to which we are accustomed.</p>

<p>The fine comb seen in <a href="#fig210">Fig. 210</a> <i>a</i> is of bone; the two coarse
combs (<a href="#fig210">Fig. 210</a> <i>b</i> and <a href="#fig214">Fig. 214</a> <i>d</i>) are of bronze.</p>

<p>The ends of the hairpins were often ornamented with figures.
The specimens shown in <a href="#fig211">Fig. 211</a> are of ivory. The designs in
which female figures appear are in keeping with the use, but
the ornamentation for the most part seems excessive.</p>

<p>The toilet boxes, of glass or ivory, were used for a variety of
purposes. Of those presented in our illustrations, one (<a href="#fig211">Fig. 211</a>,
at the right) probably contained perfumed oil. The round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
glass box (<a href="#fig212">Fig. 212</a>) was used for cosmetics, as was also the ivory
box seen in <a href="#fig214">Fig. 214</a>, the outside of which is carved in low relief.</p>

<p>The mirrors were of metal, highly polished. The one seen in
<a href="#fig214">Fig. 214</a> was designed to stand
upon a dressing case; the other
three (<a href="#fig213">Fig. 213</a>) are hand mirrors.
The frame of the rectangular
mirror is modern; whether
or not this had a handle is not
clear.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 215.&mdash;Gold arm band.</p>
</div>

<p>Jewellery of gold and silver
and other small objects wrought
in the precious metals have
now and then been found. A
characteristic example of the
jewellery is the large gold arm
band in the form of a serpent,
with eyes of rubies, found in
the house of the Faun (<a href="#fig215">Fig. 215</a>). It weighs twenty-two
ounces; to judge from the size, it must have been intended for
the upper arm.</p>

<p>Much more important, from the aesthetic point of view, are
the cups and other
articles of silver designed
for table use.
As these do not differ
essentially from objects
of the same class
found elsewhere, we
should not be warranted
in entering
upon an extended discussion
of them here;
a few examples must
suffice.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
(<i>a</i>) has a simple but effective decoration of leaves. Another
(<i>c</i>) presents the apotheosis of Homer; the bard is being carried
to heaven by an eagle, while on either side (detail in <i>b</i>) sits an
allegorical figure&mdash;the Iliad with helmet, shield, and spear, and
the Odyssey with a
sailor's cap and a steering
paddle. On the
third (<i>d</i>, detail in
<a href="#fig216">Fig. 216</a> <i>e</i>) we see a male
and a female Centaur,
with Bacchic emblems,
conversing with Cupids
posed gracefully
on their backs. This last is one of a pair found in 1835.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 216 <i>e</i>.&mdash;Detail of cup with Centaurs.</p>
</div>
<p>The Boscoreale treasure contained a hundred and three specimens
of silver ware, undoubtedly the collection of an amateur.</p>

<p>Of the purely decorative pieces the finest is the shallow bowl
(<i>phiala</i>, <i>patera</i>) 8⅞ inches in diameter, with an allegorical representation
of the city of Alexandria, in high relief (<a href="#fig187">Fig. 187</a>).
The city is personified as a female divinity&mdash;alert, powerful,
majestic. Upon her head are the spoils of an elephant; the
trunk and tusks project above, while the huge ears, hanging
down behind, are skilfully adjusted to the outline of the goddess's
neck.</p>

<p>In the fold of her chiton, held by the right hand, and in the
cornucopia resting on the left arm, are fruits of Egypt, among
which grapes and pomegranates are easily distinguished. A
representation of Helios appears in low relief upon the upper
part of the cornucopia; below is the eagle, emblem of the Ptolemies.
A lion is mounted on the right shoulder of the goddess;
in her right hand she holds an asp, sacred to Isis, with head
uplifted as in the representation described by Apuleius (Met.
XI. 4); facing the asp is a female panther.</p>

<p>Around the group in low relief are the attributes (not all distinguishable
in our illustration) of various divinities&mdash;the bow
and quiver of Artemis, the club of Hercules, the sistrum of Isis,
the forceps of Vulcan, the serpent of Aesculapius entwined
around a staff, the sword of Mars in a scabbard, and the lyre of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
Apollo. A dolphin in the midst of waves (under the right hand)
symbolizes the maritime relations of the city.</p>

<p>The central medallion (<i>emblema</i>) was made separately and
attached to the bottom of the patera. Between it and the outer
edge of the bowl is a band of pleasing ornament, composed of
sprays of myrtle and laurel. The surface of the medallion was
all gilded except the undraped portions of the goddess. The
ears of the goddess were pierced for ear-rings, which were not
found. The date of the patera can not be determined; it is
perhaps as old as the reign of Augustus.</p>

<p>Among the cups, sixteen in number, two are especially noteworthy.
They are four inches high, and form a pair; they are
ornamented with skeletons in high relief, so grouped that each
cup presents four scenes satirizing human life and its interpretation
in poetry and philosophy.</p>

<p>Two scenes from one of the cups are shown in <a href="#fig217">Fig. 217</a>. At
the left the Stoic Zeno appears, standing stiffly with his philosopher's
staff in his left hand, his wallet hanging from his neck;
with right hand extended he points the index finger in indignation
and scorn at Epicurus, who, paying no heed to him, is taking
a piece of a huge cake lying on the top of a small round table.
Beside Epicurus an eager pig with snout and left foreleg uplifted
is demanding a share. Over the cake is the inscription:
<span class="greek" title="to telos hêdonê">τὸ τέλος ἡδονή</span>, 'the end of life is pleasure.' The letters of the
inscription, as of the names of the philosophers, are too small to
be shown distinctly in our illustration.</p>

<p>No names are given with the figures in the other scene; a
kind of genre picture is presented. The skeleton in the middle
is placing a wreath of flowers upon his head. The one at the
right holds in one hand a skull which he examines contemplatively&mdash;we
are reminded of Hamlet in the scene with the gravedigger;
in the other hand (not seen in the illustration) is a
wreath of flowers. The third of the principal figures holds in
his right hand a bag exceedingly heavy, as indicated by the
adjustment of the bones of the right arm and leg; over the bag
is the word <span class="greek" title="phthonoi">φθόνοι</span>, 'envyings.' The object in the left hand is
so light that its weight is not felt; it is a butterfly, held by the
wings, and above it is inscribed <span class="greek" title="psychion">ψύχιον</span>, a diminutive of <span class="greek" title="psychê">ψυχή</span>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
'soul'; we shall later find another instance of the representation
of a disembodied soul as a butterfly (<a href="#Page_398">p. 398</a>). It was perhaps
the design of the artist to represent the figure as holding the
bag behind him while presenting the butterfly to the one who is
putting on the wreath.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig217" id="fig217"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 217.&mdash;Silver cup with skeleton groups. From the Boscoreale treasure.</p>
</div>

<p>On either side of the middle figure are two others less than
half as large. One, under the butterfly, is playing the lyre;
over his head is the word <span class="greek" title="terpsis">τέρψις</span>, 'pleasure.' The second is
clapping his hands, and above him is a Greek inscription which
gives the thought of the whole design: 'So long as you live
take your full share' of life, 'for the morrow is uncertain.'</p>

<p>Both cups had evidently long been in use; there are still some
traces of gilding, which, however, seems not to have been applied
to the skeletons. While the explanatory inscriptions are in
Greek, a Latin name, Gavia, is inscribed on the under side of
the second cup, in the same kind of letters as the record of
weight (<a href="#Page_508">p. 508</a>). The Gavii were a family of some prominence
at Pompeii; we are perhaps warranted in concluding that the
cups were made by a Greek for this Pompeian lady, and that
afterward they came into the possession of another lady,
Maxima, who formed the collection.

<h2>PART III<br />

TRADES AND OCCUPATIONS</h2>

<h3 class="chap1">CHAPTER XLVII<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE TRADES AT POMPEII.&mdash;THE BAKERS</i></span></h3>

<p>In antiquity there was no such distinction between trades and
professions as exists to-day. In the Early Empire all activity
outside the field of public service, civil and military, or the
management of estates, was considered beneath the dignity of
a Roman; the practice of law, which had received its impulse
largely from the obligation of patrons to protect their clients,
was included among public duties. The ordinary work of life
was left mainly to slaves and freedmen. Not only the trades,
as we understand the term, but architecture and engineering,&mdash;in
antiquity two branches of one occupation,&mdash;the practice of
medicine, and teaching, were looked upon as menial. A Roman
of literary or practical bent might manifest an interest in such
vocations, but it was considered hardly respectable actively to
engage in them.</p>

<p>This attitude of mind, especially toward the higher occupations,
is only explicable in the light of the social conditions then existing.
Men who kept slaves of every degree of intelligence and
training, and were at all times accustomed to command, were
not disposed to hold themselves in readiness to do another's
bidding, excepting in the service of the State alone; and work
committed to slaves and freedmen naturally came to be considered
unworthy the employment of a gentleman. The freemen
of the same craft were often united in guilds or corporations,
for the administration of certain matters of mutual interest; but
nothing is known in regard to the activities of such organizations
at Pompeii.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span></p>

<p>In a city as large as Pompeii, all the occupations corresponding
to the needs of daily life must have been represented. The remains
of the appliances and products of labor are of the most
varied character, sometimes far from satisfactory, raising more
difficulties than they solve; yet often revealing at a glance the
ancient methods of work, and casting light upon the economic
background of Greek and Roman culture. The excavations
have brought before us three sources of information, inscriptions,
paintings, and the remains of buildings or rooms used as
workshops.</p>

<p>The inscriptions refer to more than a score of occupations;
from farming to innkeeping, and from hairdressing to goldworking.
Most of them are election notices, in which the
members of a craft unite, or are exhorted to unite, in recommending
a certain candidate for a municipal office. These are
painted in red letters on the walls along the streets, and are much
alike, though some are fuller than others. The simplest form
contains only three words, as <i>Trebium aed. tonsores</i>,&mdash;'The
barbers recommend Trebius for the office of aedile.' The more
elaborate recommendations may be illustrated by the following:
<i>Verum aed. o. v. f.</i> (for <i>aedilem, oro vos, facite</i>), <i>unguentari,
facite, rog[o]</i>,&mdash;'Do make Verus aedile, perfumers, elect him, I
beg of you.' The whole craft of goldsmiths favored the election
of Pansa: <i>C. Cuspium Pansam aed. aurifices universi rog[ant]</i>,&mdash;'All
the goldsmiths recommend Gaius Cuspius Pansa for the
aedileship.'</p>

<p>The recommendations of the fruit sellers are particularly
conspicuous. On one occasion they joined with a prominent
individual in the support of a ticket: <i>M. Holconium Priscum II
vir. i. d. pomari universi cum Helvio Vestale rog.</i>,&mdash;'All the fruit
sellers, together with Helvius Vestalis, urge the election of M.
Holconius Priscus as duumvir with judiciary authority.' There
may have been some special reason why the fruiterers wished
to keep in favor with the city authorities, and so took an active
part in the elections; the dealers in garlic (<i>aliari</i>) also had a
candidate.</p>

<p>Among the representatives of other employments that joined
in the support of candidates were the dyers (<i>offectores</i>), cloak-cutters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
(<i>sagarii</i>), pack-carriers (<i>saccarii</i>), mule-drivers (<i>muliones</i>),
and fishermen (<i>piscicapi</i>). The inscription in which reference
is made to the gig-drivers is mentioned elsewhere (<a href="#Page_243">p. 243</a>).</p>

<p>The paintings in which we see work going on are numerous.
By far the most pleasing are those in which the workmen are
Cupids, busying themselves with the affairs of men. Several
pictures of this kind have already been described (<a href="#Page_97">pp. 97</a>, <a href="#Page_332">332</a>-<a href="#Page_337">337</a>);
but we ought to add to those mentioned two scenes from
Herculaneum, often reproduced, in which Cupids are represented
as carpenters and as shoemakers.</p>

<p>Among the more important paintings in which the figures of
men appear are those which picture the life of an inn and those
that present the processes of cleaning cloth; both groups are
reserved for later discussion. In a house in the ninth Region
(IX. v. 9) a stuccoer is pictured at work putting the finishing
touches on a wall with a smoothing tool, and in the house of
the Surgeon an artist is seen painting a herm (<a href="#fig133">Fig. 133</a>).</p>

<p>In only a few instances are the remains of workshops sufficiently
characteristic to indicate their purpose. Among the
most impressive, to the visitor at Pompeii, are the ruins of the
bakeries, with their large millstones (<a href="#fig218">Fig. 218</a>). Equally important,
also, are the remains of the fulleries, and of a large
tannery, which, as well as those of the inns and winerooms,
will be discussed in separate chapters.</p>

<p>A few out of the hundreds of shops opening on the streets
contain remains of the articles exposed for sale. The discovery
of charred nuts, fruits, and loaves of bread in the market stalls
north of the Macellum has already been noted (<a href="#Page_96">p. 96</a>). We
know the use of other shops from the remains of paints found
in them. The arrangements of such places of business were
discussed in connection with those of the Pompeian house.</p>

<p>Several establishments which contain large lead kettles set in
masonry, with a place for a fire underneath, have been identified
as dyehouses. In the case of one on Stabian Street (VII.
ii. 11), the identification seems complete. Nine such kettles
stood in the peristyle, which has a direct connection with the
street; in a closet were numerous bottles, part of which contained
coloring materials. There was formerly a painting on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
wall of the entrance, representing a man carrying on a pole
an object which had the appearance of a garment fresh from
the dye.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig218" id="fig218"></a>
<img src="images/fig218.jpg" width="532" height="413" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 218.&mdash;Ruins of a bakery, with millstones.</p>
</div>

<p>On the opposite side of the street is the election notice:
<i>Postumium Proculum aed. offectores rog[ant]</i>,&mdash;'The dyers
request the election of Postumius Proculus as aedile.' The
house on which this inscription is painted (IX. iii. 2) contained
three kettles similar to those already mentioned; the dyers of
both establishments may have united in supporting the candidacy
of Proculus.</p>

<p>A potter's workshop, with two ovens, is located outside the
Herculaneum Gate, where the streets divide opposite the villa
of Diomedes (<a href="#plan5">Plan V</a>, 29-30). The ovens, which are not large,
have an upper division, in which were placed the vessels to be
baked, and a firebox underneath, the floor above being pierced
with holes to let the heat through. The vault of one of the ovens
was constructed of parallel rows of jars fitted into one another.</p>

<p>There was a shoemaker's shop on the northwest corner of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
Insula VII. i opening upon two streets. It is connected with
the entrance hall of the adjoining house (No. 40), and near the
middle is a small stone table. The identification rests upon the
discovery here of certain tools, particularly leather-cutters' knives
with a crescent-shaped blade; there was also an inscription on
the wall, making record of some repairing done 'July 14, with a
sharp-cornered knife (<i>scalpro angulato</i>) and an awl.' Apparently
the porter of the house (<i>ostiarius</i>) was at the same time a cobbler,
as frequently in Italy to-day.</p>

<p>On the same wall is another scribbling: <i>M. Nonius Campanus
mil. coh. VIIII pr. &#65947; Caesi</i>,&mdash;'Marcus Nonius Campanus, a
soldier of the ninth praetorian cohort, of the century led by
Caesius.' The name of the centurion, M. Caesius Blandus, is
scratched twice on the columns of the peristyle in the same
house. Captain and private may have come from Rome in the
escort of an emperor. Perhaps the centurion was quartered in
this house; the soldier, waiting to have his shoes mended,
scratched his name upon the wall.</p>

<p>The better houses were so freely adorned with statuettes and
other ornaments of marble that there must have been marble-workers
in the city. The workshop of one was found, in 1798,
on Stabian Street, near the Large Theatre. It contained various
pieces of carving, as herms, table feet, and table tops; there was
also an unfinished mortar, together with a slab of marble partly
sawed, the saw being left in the cut.</p>

<p>Signs of shops are not often seen in Pompeii, but two or three
may be mentioned. In the wall of a shop-front in the block
containing the Baths north of the Forum, there is a terra cotta
plaque with a goat in relief, to indicate the place of a milk
dealer; and not far away we find a sign of a wineshop, a tufa
relief of two men carrying between them an amphora hung
from a pole supported on their shoulders.</p>

<p>Not all such reliefs, however, are signs of shops. Near
the Porta Marina (at the northwest corner of Insula VII. xv), a
tufa block may be seen near the top of the wall, showing a
mason's tools in relief; above it is the inscription, <i>Diogenes
structor</i>, 'Diogenes the mason.' This is not a sign&mdash;the
inscription can hardly be read from below; it is, moreover, on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
outside of a garden wall, with no house or shop entrance near
it. It is rather a workman's signature; Diogenes had built the
wall, and wished to leave a record of his skill.</p>

<p class="p2">In antiquity the miller and the baker were one person. We
rarely find in Pompeii&mdash;and then only in private houses&mdash;an
oven without mills under the same roof. There were many
bakeries in the city. The portion already excavated contains
more than twenty, each of them with three or four mills; bread
was furnished, therefore, by a number of small bakeries rather
than by a few large establishments.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 225px;"><a name="fig219" id="fig219"></a>

</ul>
</div>

<p>The appearance of a bakery to-day, with its mills and its large
oven, may be seen in <a href="#fig218">Fig. 218</a>. The arrangements can more
easily be explained, however, from
the plan of another establishment,
one of the largest, in the third Insula
of Region VI. (<a href="#fig219">Fig. 219</a>). Entering
from the street through the
fauces, we find ourselves in an atrium
of simple form (8) with rooms on
either side; the tablinum (14) is here
merely an entrance to the mill room
(15). In the corner of the atrium
is a stairway leading to a second
story, which was particularly needed
here, because the living rooms at the
rear were required for the bakery;
the floor of the second story was
supported by brick pillars at the
corners of the impluvium, joined by
flat arches.</p>

<p>The four mills (<i>b</i>), were turned
by animals; the floor around them
is paved with basalt flags like those
used for the streets. In the same room, at <i>d</i>, were the remains
of a low table; at <i>c</i> there is a cistern curb, with a large earthen
vessel for holding water on either side, while the wall above was
ornamented with a painting representing Vesta, the patron goddess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
of bakers, between the two Lares. On one side of the oven
(17) is the kneading room (18), on the other the storeroom (19).
The room at the left (16) is
the stall for the donkeys that
turned the mills.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 220.&mdash;A Pompeian mill, without its
framework.</p>
</div>

<p>The mills of Pompeii, with
slight variations, are all of
one type; if there were watermills
on the Sarno, no trace
of them has been found. The
millstones are of lava (<a href="#Page_15">p. 15</a>).
The lower stone, <i>meta</i>, has
the shape of a cone resting
on the end of a cylinder, but
the cylindrical part is in most
cases partially concealed by a
thick hoop of masonry, the
top of which was formed into a trough to receive the flour, and
was covered with sheet lead (<a href="#fig220">Fig. 220</a>). A square hole, five or
six inches across, was cut in the top of the cone, in which was
inserted a wooden standard;
this supported a vertical iron
pivot on which the frame of
the upper millstone turned.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 276px;"><a name="fig221" id="fig221"></a>
<img src="images/fig221.jpg" width="276" height="291" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 221.&mdash;Section of a mill, restored.<br />
<a href="images/fig221fs.jpg">View larger image</a></p>
</div>

<p>The shape of the upper
millstone, <i>catillus</i>, may best
be seen in <a href="#fig221">Fig. 221</a>. It was
like a double funnel, the lower
cavity being fitted to the cone
of the lower millstone, while
that in the upper part answered
the purpose of a hopper.
The two cavities were
connected at the centre by an
opening similar to that of an
hourglass, which left room for the standard and allowed the grain
to run down slowly, when the <i>catillus</i> was turned, to be ground
between the two stones. The flour ran out at the base of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
cone and fell into the trough, ready to be sifted and made into
bread.</p>

<p>The upper millstone was nicely balanced over the lower, the
surface of which it touched but lightly; it could not have rested
on the under stone with full weight, for in that case the strength
of a draft animal would not have sufficed to move it. The
stones could be set for finer or coarser grinding by changing
the length of the standard.</p>

<p>The arrangement for turning the mill was simple. In shaping
the upper millstone, strong shoulders were left in the narrowest
part (<a href="#fig220">Fig. 220</a>), on opposite sides. In these square
sockets were cut, in which the ends
of shafts were inserted and firmly
fastened by round bolts passing
through the shoulders (<a href="#fig221">Fig. 221</a>).
The shafts were tied to the ends of
the crossbeam above by curved vertical
pieces of wood, or by straps of
iron, which were let into grooves in
the stone and so made firm. The
crosspiece above, which turned on the
pivot in the end of the standard, was
sometimes of iron, sometimes of wood
with an iron socket fitting the pivot.
The framework must necessarily have
been exceedingly strong. One of the mills at Pompeii (IX. iii. 10)
has lately been set up with new woodwork, and grinds very well.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 222.&mdash;A mill in operation.
Relief in the Vatican Museum.</p>
</div>

<p>The smaller mills were turned by slaves, the larger by draft
animals. Men pushed on the projecting shafts, but animals
wore a collar which was attached by a chain or rope to the end
of the crosspiece at the top. The links of the chain running to
the crossbeam are distinctly shown in a relief in the Vatican
Museum (<a href="#fig222">Fig. 222</a>), in which a horse is represented turning a
mill. Blinders are over the eyes of the horse, which seems also
to be checked up in order to prevent eating. A square hopper
rests on the crossbeam, and the miller is bringing a measure of
wheat to pour into it. On a shelf in the corner of the room is a
lamp.

<p class="caption">Fig. 223.&mdash;Section of bake
oven.<br />
<a href="images/fig223fs.jpg">View larger image</a></p>
</div>

<p>The ovens were not unlike those still in use in many parts of
Europe. They were shaped like a low beehive, generally with
some kind of a flue in front to make the fire burn inside while
they were being heated. The oven in the
bakery described above, however, has a
special device for saving as much heat as
possible (<a href="#fig223">Fig. 223</a>); it is entirely enclosed
in a smoke chamber (<i>b</i>), with two openings
above (<i>d</i>) for the draft. Fires were
kindled in such ovens with wood or charcoal;
the latter was probably used here.
When the proper temperature for baking
had been reached, the ashes were raked out (in <a href="#fig223">Fig. 223</a>, <i>e</i> is an
ashpit), the loaves of bread shoved in, and the mouth closed to
retain the heat. A receptacle for water stands in front of our
oven (<i>f</i>), a convenience for moistening the surface of the loaves
while baking. The front of the oven (at <i>c</i>) was connected with
the rooms on either side, as may be more clearly seen by referring
to <a href="#fig219">Fig. 219</a>. In the kneading room (18), where were found
remains of a large table and shelves, the loaves were made ready,
and could be passed through one opening to the front of the
oven; the hot loaves could be conveniently passed through the
other opening into the storeroom (19).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span></p>

<p>In many establishments a machine was used for kneading;
the best example is in a bakery on the north side of Insula xiv
in Region VI. Such kneading machines are seen also in ancient
representations of the baker's trade, as in the reliefs of
the tomb of Eurysaces, near the Porta Maggiore at Rome.</p>

<p>The dough was placed in a round pan of lava a foot and a
half or two feet in diameter. In this a vertical shaft revolved,
to the lower part of which two or three wooden arms were attached
(three in <a href="#fig224">Fig. 224</a>); the one at the bottom was strengthened
by an iron crosspiece on the under side, the projecting
centre of which turned in a socket below. The side of the pan
was pierced in two or three places for the insertion of wooden
teeth, so placed as not to interfere with the revolution of the
arms. As the shaft was turned, the dough was pushed forward
by the arms and held back by the teeth, being thus thoroughly
kneaded. Modern kneading machines are constructed on the
same principle, but have two sets of teeth on horizontal cylinders
revolving toward each other.

<h3>CHAPTER XLVIII<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE FULLERS AND THE TANNERS</i></span></h3>

<p>The work of the ancient fuller was twofold, to make ready
for use the cloth fresh from the loom, and to cleanse garments
that had been worn. As the garments used by the Romans
were mainly of wool, and needed skilful manipulation to retain
their size and shape, they were ordinarily sent out of the house
to be cleansed; in consequence the trade of the fuller was relatively
important. In the part of Pompeii thus far excavated we
find two large fulleries and one smaller establishment that can
be identified with certainty; and there were doubtless many
laundries, with less ample facilities, the purpose of which is not
clearly indicated by the remains. The following account of the
processes employed relates exclusively to woollen fabrics.</p>

<p>At the time of the destruction of Pompeii, soap, a Gallic
invention, was only beginning to come into use; the commonest
substitute was fuller's earth, <i>creta fullonia</i>, a kind of alkaline
marl. For raising the nap, teasel does not seem to have been
used, as with us, but a species of thorn (<i>spina fullonia</i>) the spines
of which were mounted in a carding tool resembling a brush
(<i>aena</i>); the skin of a hedgehog also was sometimes utilized for
this purpose.</p>

<p>The fulling of new cloth involved seven or eight distinct processes,&mdash;washing
with fuller's earth, or other cleansing agents,
to remove the oily matter; beating and stretching, to make the
surface even; washing and drying a second time, for cleaning
and shrinking; combing with a carding tool to raise the nap,
brushing in order to make it ready for clipping, and shearing
to reduce the nap to proper length; then, particularly in the
case of the white woollens so commonly used, bleaching with
sulphur fumes; and finally, smoothing in a large press. The
process of cleaning soiled garments was more simple.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span></p>

<p>A series of paintings in the largest of the fulleries, on the
west side of Mercury Street, picture several of these processes
with great clearness. They were on a large pillar at the front
end of the peristyle, from which they were removed to the
Museum at Naples; they supplement admirably the scenes of
the Cupids' fullery
in the house of the
Vettii, mentioned
in a previous chapter
(<a href="#Page_335">p. 335</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 362px;"><a name="fig225" id="fig225"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 225.&mdash;Scene in a fullery: treading vats.</p>
</div>

<p>In the first picture
(<a href="#fig225">Fig. 225</a>), the
clothes are being
washed. They are
in four round treading
vats, which
stand in niches
formed by a low wall. One of the workmen is still treading his
allotment, steadying himself by resting his arms on the walls of
the niche at both
sides; the other
three have finished
treading and are
standing on the
bottom of their
tubs, rinsing the
garments before
wringing them out.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 379px;"><a name="fig226" id="fig226"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 226.&mdash;Scene in a fullery: inspection of cloth; carding;
bleaching frame.</p>
</div>

<p>The next scene
(<a href="#fig226">Fig. 226</a>) is threefold.
In the foreground
at the left
sits a richly
dressed lady, to
whom a girl brings
a garment that has
been cleaned; that
the woman is not one of those employed in the fullery is evident
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
from her elaborate headdress, necklace, and bracelets. In the
background a workman dressed in a tunic is carding a large
piece of cloth. Near by another workman carries on his shoulders
a bleaching frame, over which garments were spread to receive
the fumes of the sulphur; he holds in his left hand the
pot in which the brimstone was burned. An owl, symbol of
Minerva, who was worshipped by fullers as their patron divinity,
sits upon the frame; and the man underneath has on his head
a wreath of leaves from the olive tree, which was sacred to the
same goddess.</p>

<p>In the third picture a young man hands a garment to a girl;
at the right a woman is
cleaning a carding tool.
The fourth (<a href="#fig227">Fig. 227</a>) gives
an excellent representation
of a fuller's press, worked
by two upright screws; it
is so much like our modern
presses as to need no explanation.
The festoons
with which it is adorned
are of olive leaves.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 293px;"><a name="fig227" id="fig227"></a>
<img src="images/fig227.jpg" width="293" height="319" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 227.&mdash;A fuller's press.</p>
</div>

<p>With these pictures before
us, it will be easy to
understand the plan of the
fullery on the west side of
Stabian Street, opposite
the house of Caecilius Jucundus (<a href="#fig228">Fig. 228</a>). It was excavated
in 1875. The building was not originally designed for a
fuller's establishment, but for a private house, and part of the
rooms were retained for domestic use, as the well preserved
kitchen (<i>d</i>), and some of the other rooms opening off from the
atrium (<i>b</i>). The furniture of the atrium&mdash;a table in front of
the impluvium, with a pedestal for a fountain figure, and a
marble basin to receive the jet&mdash;is like that of the house the
interior of which is shown in <a href="#plate07">Plate VII</a>.</p>

<p>The fuller's appliances are found in the shop next to the
entrance (21), and in the peristyle (<i>q</i>). In the former are the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
foundations of three treading vats, and on the opposite side an
oblong depression in which the press was placed. The peristyle
contains three large basins of masonry for soaking and rinsing
the clothes. A jet of water fell into the one next the rear wall
(3), from which it ran into the other two through holes in the
sides. Along the wall is a raised walk (4) on a level with the
top of the basins, into which the workmen descended by means
of steps. At the ends of this walk are places for seven treading
vats, five in one group, two in the other. The wall above is
decorated with a long
sketchy painting, in
which the fullers are
seen engaged in the
celebration of a festival,&mdash;doubtless
the
Quinquatrus, the feast
of Minerva; the celebration
is followed by
a scene before a magistrate,
resulting from a
fight engaged in by the celebrants. A mass of fuller's earth
was found in the passage at <i>m</i>.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 228.&mdash;Plan of a fullery.<br />
<a href="images/fig228fs.jpg">View larger image</a></p>
</div>

<p>From the receipts found in the house of Caecilius Jucundus,
it appears that this thrifty Pompeian, in the years 56-60 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>,
rented a fullery belonging to the city. In view of the nearness
of this establishment to his house, it seems likely that he was in
charge of the business here. At the time of the eruption,
however, the enterprise was in the hands of Marcus Vesonius
Primus, who lived in the house next door (No. 20), where a portrait
herm, dedicated to him by his cashier (<i>arcarius</i>), stands in
the atrium; the house is often called the house of Orpheus, from
the large painting on the rear wall of the garden.</p>

<p>To judge from the election notices painted on the front of the
fullery and on the houses at either side, Primus must have taken
an active interest in local politics. He was an ardent partisan,
as witness this inscription: <i>Cn. Helvium aed. d. r. p.</i> (for <i>aedilem,
dignum re publica</i>) <i>Vesonius Primus rogat</i>,&mdash;'Vesonius
Primus urges the election of Gnaeus Helvius as aedile, a man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
worthy of public office.' The endorsement of Gavius Rufus is
even stronger: <i>C. Gavium Rufum II vir. o. v. f. utilem r. p.
(duumvirum, oro vos, facite, utilem rei publicae) Vesonius Primus
rogat</i>,&mdash;'Vesonius Primus requests the election of Gaius Gavius
Rufus as duumvir, a man serviceable to public interests; do
elect him, I beg of you.'</p>

<p>In one of the shorter recommendations, Primus names his
occupation: <i>L. Ceium Secundum II v. i. d. Primus fullo
ro[gat]</i>,&mdash;'Primus the fuller asks the election of Lucius Ceius
Secundus as duumvir with judiciary authority.' On one occasion
he united with his employees in favoring a candidate for
the aedileship: <i>Cn. Helvium Sabinum aed. Primus cum suis
fac[it]</i>,&mdash;'Primus and his household are working for the election
of Gnaeus Helvius Sabinus as aedile.'</p>

<p>The fullery on Mercury Street, like that just described, had
been made over from a private house, built in the pre-Roman
period. Among other changes, the columns of the large peristyle
were replaced by massive pillars of masonry supporting a
gallery above for the drying of clothes. At the rear are four
square basins, the two larger of which are more than seven feet
across; the water passed from one to the other as in the basins
of Primus's fullery. In the corner near the last basin are six
rectangular niches for treading vats, separated by a low wall, the
purpose of which is clear from <a href="#fig225">Fig. 225</a>. There is a vaulted
room at the right of the peristyle, with a cistern curb, a large
basin of masonry, and a stone table. Here a substance was
found which the excavators supposed to be soap, but which was
doubtless fuller's earth, like that found in the establishment on
Stabian Street.</p>

<p class="p2">There were naturally fewer tanners than fullers; and so far
only one tannery has been discovered. That is a large establishment,
however, filling almost an entire block near the Stabian
Gate (Ins. I. v), excavated in 1873. Like the two larger
fulleries, it occupied a building designed for a house. The
appliances of the craft are found in only a small part of the
structure; they relate to two processes,&mdash;the preparation of
the fluids used for tanning, and the manipulation of the hides.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span></p>

<p>The mixture for the tan vats was prepared in a tank under a
colonnade opening on the garden. It could be drawn off through
two holes in the side into a smaller basin below, or conducted by
means of a gutter running along the wall to three large earthen
vessels.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 330px;"><a name="fig229" id="fig229"></a>
<img src="images/fig229.jpg" width="330" height="277" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 229.&mdash;Plan of the vat room of the tannery.<br />
<a href="images/fig229fs.jpg">View larger image</a></p>
</div>

<p>The vats, fifteen in number, are in a room formerly used as an
atrium (<a href="#fig229">Fig. 229</a>). They are about 5 feet in diameter, and
from 4 to about 5½ feet
deep; they were built of
masonry, and plastered;
two holes were made in
the side of each to serve
as a convenience in
climbing in and out.
Between adjacent pairs
of pits was an oblong basin
about twenty inches
deep, lined with wood.
On either side of this
was a large earthen jar,
sunk in the earth; a
small, round hole between the basin and each jar seems to mark
the place of a pipe tile, connected with the former at the bottom.
The large pits were for ordinary tanning; the oblong
basins were probably used in making fine leather (<i>aluta</i>), a process
in which alum was the principal agent, the chemicals being
placed in the jars on either side, and supplied to the basins
through the pipe tiles.</p>

<p>In the same building four tools were found, similar to those
used by tanners at the present time. One was a knife, of
bronze, with a charred wooden handle on the back of the blade;
two were scraping irons, with a handle on each end; and there
was another iron tool with a crescent-shaped blade.</p>

<p>The garden on which the colonnade opened contains an open-air
triclinium. The table was ornamented with a mosaic top,
now in the Naples Museum, with a characteristic design
(<a href="#fig230">Fig. 230</a>). The principal motive is a skull; below is a butterfly on
the rim of a wheel, symbols of the fluttering of the disembodied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
soul and of the flight of time. On the right and on the left are the
spoils that short-lived man leaves behind him,&mdash;here a wanderer's
staff, a wallet, and a beggar's tattered robe; there, a sceptre,
with a mantle of royal purple. Over all is a level, with the
plumb line hanging straight, symbolic of Fate, that sooner or
later equalizes the lots of all mankind. The thought of the
tanner, or of the earlier proprietor of the house, is easy to
divine: <i>Mors aurem vellens, Vivite, ait, venio</i>,</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLIX<br />

<span class="s08"><i>INNS AND WINESHOPS</i></span></h3>

<p>Wineshops, <i>cauponae</i>, were numerous in Pompeii, and the
remains are easily identified. Like the Italian <i>osterie</i>, they were
at the same time eating houses, but the arrangements for drinking
were the more conspicuous, and give character to the ruins.
The Roman inn, <i>hospitium</i>, or simply <i>caupona</i>, was a wineshop
with accommodations for the night, provision being also made
in most cases for the care of animals. Keepers of inns, <i>caupones</i>,
are frequently mentioned in Pompeian inscriptions, sometimes in
election notices, more often in graffiti.</p>

<p>Several inns have been identified from signs and from scribblings
on the walls within. At the entrance of one (west side
of Ins. IX. vii) is painted <i>Hospitium Hygini Firmi</i>, 'Inn of
Hyginius Firmus.' The front of the 'Elephant Inn' (west
side of Ins. VII. i) was ornamented with the painting of an elephant
in the coils of a serpent, defended by a pygmy. The
name of the proprietor is perhaps given at the side: <i>Sittius
restituit elephantu[m]</i>, 'Sittius restored the elephant,' referring
no doubt to the repainting of the sign. Evidently the owner,
whether Sittius or some one else, was anxious to rent the premises;
below the elephant is the painted notice: <i>Hospitium hic
locatur&mdash;triclinium cum tribus lectis</i>,&mdash;'Inn to let. Triclinium
with three couches.' The rest of the inscription is illegible.</p>

<p>The plan of another inn in the same region (west side of
VII. xii) well illustrates the arrangements of these hostelries
(<a href="#fig231">Fig. 231</a>). The main room (<i>a</i>), which probably served as a
dining room, is entered directly from the street. At one side is
the kitchen (<i>h</i>); six sleeping rooms (<i>b-g</i>) open upon the other
sides. But the landlord did not provide merely for the entertainment
of guests from out of town; he endeavored to attract
local patronage also, by means of a wineshop (<i>n</i>), which opened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
upon the street and had a separate dining room (<i>o</i>). A short
passage (<i>i</i>) led from the main room to the stalls (<i>k</i>), in front of
which was a watering trough. The vehicles were probably
crowded into the recess at <i>m</i>, or the front of <i>a</i>.
The two side rooms (<i>l</i> and <i>p</i>) were closets.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 138px;"><a name="fig231" id="fig231"></a>
<img src="images/fig231.jpg" width="138" height="232" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 231.&mdash;Plan of an
inn.<br />
<a href="images/fig231fs.jpg">View larger image</a></p>
</div>

<p>The walls of several of the rooms contain
records of the sojourn of guests. C. Valerius
Venustus, 'a pretorian of the first cohort, enrolled
in the century of Rufus,' scratched his
name on the wall of <i>c</i>, to which also an affectionate
husband confided his loneliness: 'Here
slept Vibius Restitutus all by himself, his heart
filled with longings for his Urbana.' Four
players, one of them a Martial, passed a night
together in the same apartment. In the next
room (<i>d</i>) a patriotic citizen of Puteoli left a
greeting for his native town: 'Well be it ever with Puteoli, colony
of Nero, of the Claudian line; C. Julius Speratus wrote this.'
This city, as we learn from Tacitus, received permission from
Nero to call itself Colonia Claudia Neronensis. Lucifer and
Primigenius, two friends, spent a night in room <i>f</i>, Lucceius
Albanus of Abellinum (Avellino) in <i>g</i>.</p>

<p>The arrangement of rooms here is so unlike that of an ordinary
house that the building must have been designed at the
beginning for a tavern. Sometimes a dwelling was turned into
an inn, as in the case of the house of Sallust, which, as we have
seen, in the last years of the city must in part at least have
been used as a hostelry.</p>

<p>Inns near the gates had a paved entrance for wagons, interrupting
the sidewalk. A good example is the inn of Hermes, in
the first block on the right as one came into the city by the Stabian
Gate (<a href="#fig232">Fig. 232</a>). On either side of the broad entrance (<i>a</i>),
are winerooms (<i>b</i>, <i>d</i>). Behind the stairway at the right, which
leads from the street to the second story, is a hearth with a
water heater. On the wall at the left was formerly a painting
with the two Lares and the Genius offering sacrifice; below was
the figure of a man pouring wine from an amphora into an
earthen hogshead (<i>dolium</i>), and beside it was written <i>Hermes</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
apparently the name of the proprietor. The wagons stood in
the large room at the rear (<i>f</i>), with which the narrow stable (<i>k</i>)
is connected; in one corner is a watering trough of masonry.
On the ground floor were only three sleeping rooms (<i>e</i>, <i>g</i>, and <i>h</i>),
but there were upper rooms at the rear, reached
by a flight of stairs in <i>f</i>; these were probably
not connected with the upper rooms of the front
part, which (over <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>), having a street
entrance, may have been rented separately.</p>

<p>The Pompeian inns were doubtless fair
representatives of their class in the different
Roman cities. Those of Rome must have been
numerous, but are rarely mentioned, and innkeepers
are generally referred to in terms of
disrespect. The ordinary charges seem to have
been low, and the accommodations were of a
corresponding character. Owing to the universal
custom of furnishing private entertainment to all with whom
there existed any ground of hospitality, places of public entertainment
tended to become the resorts of the vicious.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2">The wineshop of which the plan is here given (<a href="#fig233">Fig. 233</a>) is on
the east side of Mercury Street, at the northwest corner of Ins.
VI. x. It was designed not only for the accommodation
of guests who would go inside
to partake of refreshments, but also for the
sale of drinks over the counter to those who
might stop a moment in passing. This is evident
from the arrangement of the main room
(<i>a</i>), which has a long counter in front, with a
series of small marble shelves arranged like stairs on one end of
it, for the display of cups and glasses; on the other is a place
for heating a vessel over a fire. Large jars are set in the counter,
in which liquids and eatables could be kept. In the corner of
the room, at the right as one enters, a hearth is placed. In
view of the provision for heating water, we are safe in calling
this a <i>thermopolium</i>, a wineshop which made a specialty of furnishing
hot drinks. The passage at the rear of the hearth (<i>c</i>)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
is connected with a small room (<i>d</i>) and also with the adjoining
house, which may have been the residence of the proprietor,
or may have been used for lodgings.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 331px;"><a name="fig234" id="fig234"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 234.&mdash;Scene in a wineshop.<br />
Wall painting.</p>
</div>

<p>The long room with an entrance from the side street (<i>b</i>, now
walled up) was intended
for the use of
those who preferred to
eat and drink at their
leisure. The walls are
decorated with a series
of paintings presenting
realistic scenes from
the life of such places.
We see the guests eating,
drinking, and playing
with dice. Some
are standing, others sitting
on stools; it is the
kind of public house that Martial calls a 'stool-ridden cookshop,'
in which couches were not provided, but only seats without
backs (Mart. Ep. V. lxx. 3).</p>

<p>In one of the scenes (<a href="#fig234">Fig. 234</a>) four men are drinking, about
a round table, while a boy waits on them; two of the figures
have pointed hoods like those
seen to-day in Sicily and some
parts of Italy. Strings of
sausage, hams, and other eatables
hang from a pole suspended
under the ceiling.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 272px;"><a name="fig235" id="fig235"></a>
<img src="images/fig235.jpg" width="272" height="217" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 235.&mdash;Delivery of wine.<br />
Wall painting.</p>
</div>

<p>Some of the figures in the
pictures are accompanied by
inscriptions. Thus by the
side of a guest for whom a
waiter is pouring out a glass
of wine is written: <i>Da fridam
pusillum</i>, 'Add cold water&mdash;just a little.' In a similar
connection we read, <i>Adde calicem Setinum</i>, 'Another cup of
Setian!' The Setian wine came from a town in Latium at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
foot of the hills bordering the Pontine Marshes, now Sezze; we
infer that our wineshop sold not merely the products of neighboring
vineyards, but choice brands from other regions as well.
Wines from the locality were probably brought to town in amphorae;
the delivery of a consignment from a distance is shown
in a separate scene (<a href="#fig235">Fig. 235</a>), in which amphorae are being
filled from a large skin on a wagon; the team of mules is meanwhile
resting, unharnessed, the yoke hanging on the end of the
pole.</p>

<p>The pictures present the life of a tavern from the point of
view of the landlord; but occasionally we have a suggestion
of the other side, as in the following couplet, the faulty spelling
of which we can forgive on account of its pithiness: <i>Talia te
fallant utinam me[n]dacia, copo, Tu ve[n]des acuam et bibes
ipse merum</i>,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>'Landlord, may your lies malign</p>
<p class="i1">Bring destruction on your head!</p>
<p>You yourself drink unmixed wine,</p>
<p class="i1">Water sell your guests instead.'</p>
</div></div>
<p>The wineshop in which this graffito is found (I. ii. 24) is
larger than that on Mercury Street, and has several dining
rooms. Connected with it is a garden with a triclinium, once
shaded by vines, which calls to mind the invitation of the barmaid
in the Copa:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Here a garden you will find,</p>
<p class="i1">Cool retreat, with cups and roses,</p>
<p>Lute and pipe, for mirth designed,</p>
<p class="i1">Bower that mask of reeds encloses.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Come, weary traveller, lie and rest</p>
<p class="i1">'Neath the shade of vines o'er-spreading.</p>
<p>Wreath of roses freshly pressed</p>
<p class="i1">On your head its fragrance shedding.'</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>All the pictures found in Pompeian wineshops bear out the
inference, based upon numerous allusions in classical writers,
that such places everywhere were in the main frequented by
the lower classes; among the adjectives applied to taverns by
the poets are 'dirty,' 'smoky,' and 'black.' They were haunted
by gamblers and criminals, and the life was notoriously immoral.</p>

<h2>PART IV<br />

THE TOMBS</h2>

<h3 class="chap1">CHAPTER L<br />

<span class="s08"><i>POMPEIAN BURIAL PLACES.&mdash;THE STREET OF TOMBS</i></span></h3>

<p>The tombs of Pompeii, like those of Rome, were placed in
close array along the sides of the roads that led from the city
gates. Only a few have been uncovered; how many still lie
concealed under the mantle of volcanic débris that rests upon
the plain, no one has yet ventured to conjecture. The tombstone
of a magistrate of one of the suburbs was found at Scafati,
a mile and a half east of the ancient town; and others have been
brought to light on the east, south, and west sides. The most
interesting and best known tombs are those of the Street of
Tombs, in front of the Herculaneum Gate; but important remains
have been found also near the Stabian and Nocera gates,
and burial places of a humbler sort lie along the city wall near
the Nola Gate.</p>

<p>Most of the tombs thus far excavated belong to the Early
Empire, having been built between the reign of Augustus and
79 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> Two or three date from the end of the Republic; and
a small corner of an Oscan cemetery has been uncovered on the
northwest side of the city. Remains of skeletons were found
only in the Oscan graves; the Roman burial places were all
arranged with reference to the practice of cremation, the ashes
being deposited in urns.</p>

<p>The tombs present so great a variety of form and construction
that it is impossible to classify them in a summary way, or to
dismiss them with the presentation of two or three typical examples.
The character of the monument varied not merely according
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
to the taste and means, but also according to the point of
view or religious feeling of the builder. Some deemed it more
fitting that the ashes of the dead should be covered over with
earth; others preferred to place them in a conspicuous tomb
that would please the eye and impress the imagination of the
beholder. To many the matter of paramount importance seemed
to be the provision for the worship of the dead, the arrangement
of the tomb so that offerings could easily be made to the ashes.
Others still desired to have the sepulchre convenient for the living,
who at times would gather there, and tarry near the resting
place of the departed. And there were not a few who attempted,
in the construction of a monument, to accomplish at the same
time several of these ends. The architectural designs were suggested
by the form of an altar, a temple, a niche, a commemorative
arch, or a semicircular bench, <i>schola</i>.</p>

<p>On account of this diversity of aim and of type, it will be most
convenient to study the tombs in topographical groups, commencing
with those at the northwest corner of the city.</p>

<p class="p2">The highway that passes under the Herculaneum Gate runs
almost directly west, descending with a gentle grade. Above it
on the north side is the ridge formed by the stream of lava on
the end of which the city lay; here, before the eruption, were
sightly villas. Below, to the south, was the sea, not so far away
as now, over the shimmering surface of which the traveller, as
he rode along, could catch charming glimpses of the heights
above Sorrento and of Capri. A short distance from the gate
on the left, a branch road, which for convenience we may call
the Bay Road, led directly to the sea. Another branch, on the
right, followed the direction of the city wall; further from the
gate on the same side, a third, which may be designated as
the Vesuvius Road, ran off from the highway in the direction
of the mountain. The highway itself, so far as excavated, has
been named the Street of Tombs.</p>

<p>The tombs that have been uncovered here are distributed in
four groups. The first, on the left side, extends from the gate
to the Bay Road; it comprises Nos. 1-4<i>a</i> on <a href="#plan5">Plan V</a>. The
second, on the right (Nos. 1-9), includes the tombs between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
gate and the beginning of the Vesuvius Road. The third group,
on the left, lies between the ruins of the villa to which the name
of Cicero has been attached and the villa of Diomedes; the
tombs are numbered on the plan 16-23. The monuments of
the fourth group occupy the tongue of ground at the right between
the highway and the Vesuvius Road (33-43). The outer
parts of the two villas by which the continuity of the series of
tombs on both sides is interrupted, appear to have been used as
inns; along the street in front of each there was a colonnade
supported by pillars, behind which were small rooms opening
toward the street.</p>

<p>At the further end of the villa on the right (10-29) is the potter's
workshop (29-30), mentioned in a previous chapter (<a href="#Page_386">p. 386</a>).
Beyond this are the Oscan graves (31-32), several of which have
been explored. In them were found rough stone coffins, made of
slabs and fragments of limestone, containing remains of skeletons
together with small painted vases, of the sort manufactured in
Campania in the third and second centuries <span class="s08">B.C.</span> Two coins
were found, in separate graves, with Oscan legends that have
not yet been deciphered; apparently they were from Nola.
The burial places lie close together, and evidently belong to a
cemetery for people of humble station; there are no headstones
to mark the graves. This is the only place at Pompeii in which
painted vases have been found.</p>

<p>A narrow strip of land on each side of the road belonged to
the city, and burial lots therein were granted by the municipal
council to citizens who had rendered public service. Others,
however, might obtain lots by purchase; private ownership may
be assumed unless the gift of the city is indicated in the inscription.
The location of several tombs&mdash;1, 3, 4, 6 on the right,
3 on the left&mdash;shows that the direction of the street near the
gate was changed after sepulchral monuments had begun to be
erected.</p>

<p>An interesting inscription referring to the municipal ownership
of land was found at the further corner of the Bay Road:
<i>Ex auctoritate imp. Caesaris Vespasiani Aug. loca publica a privatis
possessa T. Suedius Clemens tribunus causis cognitis et
mensuris factis rei publicae Pompeianorum restituit</i>,&mdash;'By virtue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
of authority conferred upon him by the Emperor Vespasian
Caesar Augustus, Titus Suedius Clemens, tribune, having investigated
the facts and taken measurements, restored to the city
of Pompeii plots of ground belonging to it which were in the
possession of private individuals.'</p>

<p>To judge from the location of the inscription, the land which
the military tribune sent as commissioner by Vespasian gave
back to the city, must have been at the sides of the Bay Road.
A marble statue of a man dressed in a toga and holding a scroll
in his hand, was found near by. It was probably a portrait of
Suedius Clemens, and may have stood in a niche in the villa of
Cicero.</p>

<p>There is an implied reference to the Bay Road also in another
inscription which was found out of its proper place, in the court
of the adjoining inn: <span class="smcap">THERMAE · M · CRASSI · FRVGI · AQVA ·
MARINA · ET · BALN · AQVA · DVLCI · IANVÁRIVS · L</span>&mdash;'Bathing
establishment of Marcus Crassus Frugi. Warm sea baths and
freshwater baths. (Superintendent) the freedman Januarius.'
We learn from Pliny the Elder that M. Licinius Crassus Frugi,
who was consul in 64 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>, and was afterwards (in 68) put to
death by Nero, owned a hot spring which gushed up out of the
sea. This spring, then, was at Pompeii, and was utilized for
baths. The inscription is at the same time an advertisement
and a sign directing people down the Bay Road to the bath
house.</p>

<p>A general view of the Street of Tombs is given in <a href="#plate10">Plate X</a>.
It is taken from the high ground beyond the fourth group, as
one looks toward the Herculaneum Gate. The rugged mass of
Monte Sant' Angelo looms up in the distance; at the right the
trees skirting the edge of the excavations form an effective background.
The beauty of the surroundings, especially on a summer
morning, the associations of the street, its deserted appearance,
and the unbroken, oppressive stillness give rise to mingled
feelings of pleasure and sadness in the visitor.</p>

<p>We commence our survey with the first group of tombs
at the left as one passes out from the Herculaneum Gate.
Close by the gate is the tomb of Cerrinius Restitutus (1 on
the plan, left side). It is simply a low vaulted niche, having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
seats at the sides. Against the rear wall stood a marble tombstone,
with a place for a carved portrait; in front of it was a
small altar under which doubtless was placed the urn containing
the ashes. Both altar and tombstone (now in the Naples
Museum) have the inscription: <i>M. Cerrinius Restitutus, Augustalis,
loc. d. d. d.</i> (for <i>locus datus decurionum decreto</i>),&mdash;'Marcus
Cerrinius Restitutus, member of the brotherhood of Augustus.
Place of burial granted by vote of the city council.' The tomb
here was designed as a structure to which relatives might repair
on anniversary days in order to make offerings to the dead.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig236" id="fig236"></a>
<img src="images/fig236.jpg" width="534" height="250" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 236.&mdash;Sepulchral benches of Veius and Mamia; tombs of Porcius and the Istacidii.</p>
</div>

<p>The remains of the other tombs in the first group are shown
in the accompanying illustration (<a href="#fig236">Fig. 236</a>). We notice first two
large semicircular benches. That at the left (2 on the plan)
marks the resting-place of Veius. It is of tufa, and nearly
twenty feet wide at the front. The ends are modelled to represent
winged lion's paws, the carving of which is full of vigor
and may be compared with that of the lion's paws in the Small
Theatre (<a href="#fig070">Fig. 70</a>). The statue that once stood at the rear, on a
high pedestal, has disappeared, but the inscription remains:
<i>A. Veio M. f. II vir. i. d. iter. quinq. trib. milit. ab populo ex
d. d.</i>,&mdash;'To the memory of Aulus Veius, son of Marcus, twice
duumvir with judiciary authority, quinquennial duumvir, military
tribune by the choice of the people. (Erected) by order of the
city council.' The city not only gave a burial place, but built
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
the tomb as well. The cinerary urn was probably placed in the
earth in the narrow unwalled space behind the bench.</p>

<p>This monument was intended at the same time to do honor to
the dead and render service to the living. Here, on feast days
of the dead, relatives could gather and partake of a commemorative
meal; but at all times the inviting seat and conspicuous
statue served to maintain that friendly relation with the living,
the desire for which so often finds expression in Roman epitaphs.
The portrait and inscription made it seem as if Veius himself
offered a friendly greeting to those that passed by, and was
greeted by them in turn as they looked upon his face and read
his name.</p>

<p>The other bench (4) was evidently built by the heirs of a
priestess, Mamia, upon a lot given by the city. The inscription
appears in large letters on the back of the seat: <i>Mamiae P. f.
sacerdoti publicae; locus sepultur[ae] datus decurionum decreto</i>,&mdash;'To
the memory of Mamia, daughter of Publius Mamius, priestess
of the city. Place of burial granted by order of the municipal
council.' In this instance, also, the cinerary urn was
probably buried in the earth behind the bench. A certain delicacy
in the modelling of the lion's paws seems to indicate for
this monument a somewhat later date than that of the monument
to Veius,&mdash;possibly the end of the reign of Augustus, or
the reign of Tiberius. The date of erection is not given in the
case of any Pompeian tomb.</p>

<p>Between the two benches we see a lava base and the core of
a superstructure; they belong to the tomb of Marcus Porcius.
The name is known from a boundary inscription which appears
on two small blocks of lava at the corners of the lot in front:
<i>M. Porci M. f. ex dec. decret. in frontem ped. xxv, in agrum ped.
xxv</i>,&mdash;'(Lot) of Marcus Porcius son of Marcus, granted by
order of the city council; twenty-five feet front, twenty-five
feet deep.'</p>

<p>This Porcius may have been one of the builders of the Small
Theatre and the Amphitheatre, or a son of that Porcius, whose
name appears on the altar of the temple of Apollo. The tomb
was in the form of an altar; the terminal volutes at the top, of
travertine, have been preserved. The sides were of tufa blocks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
which may have been carried off for building purposes after the
tomb was damaged by the earthquake of 63. The interior was
made hollow to save expense; there was no sepulchral chamber,
the ashes being placed in the earth under the monument. This
tomb is the oldest of the group.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig237" id="fig237"></a>
<img src="images/fig237.jpg" width="439" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 237.&mdash;The tomb of the Istacidii, restored.</p>
</div>

<p>The conspicuous monument of the Istacidii (4 <i>a</i>) stands behind
the tombs of Mamia and Porcius, at the left of the Bay Road.
It is raised upon a narrow terrace, enclosed by a balustrade of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
masonry, and has the appearance of a temple, with half-columns
at the sides. The remains of the lower story alone are seen in
<a href="#fig236">Fig. 236</a>; above this was a circular structure formed by columns
supporting a roof, under which were placed statues of members
of the family (<a href="#fig237">Fig. 237</a>). The lower story contains a sepulchral
chamber, entered by a door at the rear; in the middle of the
chamber is a massive pillar reaching to the vaulted ceiling. The
decoration of the room is simple, of the third style. On one side
is a large niche, for two urns, those of the head of the family
and his wife; the other three sides contain ten smaller niches.</p>

<p>The principal inscription of the tomb has not been found, but
a number of names are preserved on the commemorative stones
set up in the plot of ground about it. These stones are of a
peculiar type, met with elsewhere only at Capua and Sorrento;
we shall call them bust stones. The outline resembles that of
a human head and neck terminating below in a pillar, but the
front was left smooth, and an inscription was cut or painted on
the bust. Difference of sex was indicated by the treatment of
the hair; an example maybe seen in <a href="#fig240">Fig. 240</a>. The bust stones
of men are generally larger than those of women; those of children
are still smaller, the size perhaps varying with the age.</p>

<p>The bust stones here may refer to those whose ashes were
deposited in urns in the tomb, or to others whose urns were
buried in the plot of ground in which it stands. From them we
learn that the head of the family was Numerius Istacidius, and
that he had a daughter, Istacidia Rufilla, who was a priestess.
Representatives of two other families, the Melissaei and the
Buccii, are named on similar stones found in a plot connected
with that of the Istacidii at the rear. The three families were
perhaps closely connected by intermarriage. The bust stone
of one of the Melissaei, Gnaeus Melissaeus Aper, duumvir in
3-4 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>, stood in the same enclosure with those of the Istacidii.</p>

<p>Only one of the nine tombs in the second group (2) bears a
name. In the case of two (3 and 4) the superstructure has
completely disappeared, leaving only the lava bases in place.
Another (5) has not been excavated; the front of the burial lot
has been cleared, but the monument, lying further back, is still
covered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span></p>

<p>The first tomb lies in the angle between the highway and the
branch road along the wall, which was evidently laid out after
the monument was erected. It has the form of an altar, and
must have resembled in appearance the tomb of Porcius on the
opposite side of the street. Here, however, there is a sepulchral
chamber in the base, entered by a low, narrow passage,
which was closed until 1887 by a block of stone. In corners of
this chamber two cinerary urns, in lead cases, were found
covered with earth and with the remains of a funeral pyre&mdash;bits
of wood and iron nails used in building the pyre, together
with pieces of a richly carved ivory casket and broken perfume
vials of terra cotta. Among the fragments of bone in each urn
was a coin of Augustus. Though the ashes of the dead were
here placed in a burial vault, it was nevertheless considered
important to cover them with earth. It was not thought necessary,
however, to leave the vault accessible for the performance
of sacred rites in honor of the dead; the entrance, securely
closed, was only to be unsealed for the admission of new urns.</p>

<p>The next tomb (2) is of an entirely different type from any of
those previously described. It is an unroofed enclosure, entered
by a door at one end. As we learn from the inscription, it was
built in honor of Terentius Felix by his widow, the city furnishing
the burial lot and a contribution of two thousand sesterces
(about $90) toward the expense: <i>T. Terentio T. f. Men. Felici
maióri aedil[i]; huic publice locus datus et &#65944; ∞ ∞. Fabia
Probi f. Sabina uxor</i>,&mdash;'To the memory of Titus Terentius
Felix the Elder, son of Titus, of the tribe Menenia, aedile. The
place of burial was given by the city, with two thousand sesterces.
His wife, Fabia Sabina, daughter of Fabius Probus
(built this monument).' Pompeians who were Roman citizens
were enrolled in the tribe Menenia.</p>

<p>The cinerary urn of Felix was of glass. It was protected by
a lead case and placed in an earthen jar, which was buried in
the earth under a small altar or table of masonry against the
wall on the left as one enters. Here also was a tombstone,
with the inscription, 'To the elder Terentius'; he probably left
a son with the same name. In the urn, or near it, were found
two coins, one of Augustus, the other of Claudius, deposited to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
pay the fare of Charon. The right side of the enclosure was
set off by a low wall; here several urns belonging to other
members of the household were buried. Shells of oysters and
other shellfish were found in the main room, remains of a
banquet in honor of the dead; the libations were poured upon
the earth above the urns. The plan of this tomb closely resembles
that of the enclosure in front of the Doric temple in
the Forum Triangulare (<a href="#Page_139">p. 139</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig238" id="fig238"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 238.&mdash;View of the Street of Tombs.<br />
At the left, the Bay Road and remains of the so-called villa of Cicero; at the right, Garland
tomb, foundation of the tomb of the Blue Glass Vase, and semicircular niche.</p>
</div>

<p>Of the remaining tombs of the second group, two are prominent,
and may readily be distinguished in the accompanying
illustration (<a href="#fig238">Fig. 238</a>), the so-called Garland tomb (6 on the
plan), and the roofed semicircular niche at the end (9). The
Garland tomb has the shape of a temple, with pilasters instead
of columns, between which hang festoons of leaves and flowers.
It is solid; the cinerary urn was probably placed underneath.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
The form of the second story cannot be determined. The material
is tufa, coated with white stucco, and the monument is one
of the oldest in the series, dating from the end of the Republic.</p>

<p>Adjoining the Garland tomb is a simple sepulchral enclosure
(7) with an entrance from the street. Between this and the
roofed niche we see in <a href="#fig238">Fig. 238</a> the limestone base of a tomb,
like those seen in <a href="#plate10">Plate X</a>, at the right; the altar-shaped
superstructure has disappeared (8). This is called the tomb
of the Blue Glass Vase. The base contains a sepulchral
chamber, entered by a door at the rear. Here three urns, two
of glass and one of terra cotta, were found, standing in niches.
On the floor were several statuettes, a couple of small figures of
animals, and a mask with a Phrygian cap,&mdash;all of terra cotta.</p>

<p>In beauty of material, harmony of design, and skill of workmanship,
one of the glass urns, which gave the name to the
tomb and is now preserved in the Naples Museum, ranks with
the finest examples of its class in the world. Among specimens
of ancient glass it stands second only to the famous Portland
vase in the British Museum, which was found in a tomb near
Rome. The urn has the form of an amphora; the support seen
at the bottom (<a href="#fig239">Fig. 239</a>) is modern. It is decorated with reliefs
cut in a layer of pure white on a background of dark blue.
Near the bottom is a narrow band, showing goats and sheep in
pasture. Resting on this are two bacchic masks, on opposite
sides of the vase; vines laden with clusters rise in graceful
arabesques above the masks, dividing the body of the vase into
two fields, which present scenes from the vintage.</p>

<p>One of these scenes is reproduced in <a href="#fig239">Fig. 239</a>. The vintage
is interpreted as a festival of Bacchus. Above is a festoon of
fruits and flowers. At the sides are two boys on elevated seats,
one playing the double flute, the other holding a Pan's pipe in
his hands, ready to take his turn; the grapes are gathered and
pressed to an accompaniment of Bacchic airs, the two players
following each other with alternate strains. A third boy, treading
the grapes in a round vat, shakes the thyrsus in honor of
the Wine-god, while a companion empties in fresh bunches.
The scene is full of action; no reproduction can do justice to
the delicacy and finish of the original.

<p class="caption">Fig. 239.&mdash;Glass vase with vintage scene, found in the tomb of the Blue Glass Vase.</p>
</div>

<p>A bench of masonry runs along the inner wall of the semicircular
niche (9), which is covered by a roof in the form of a
half dome and opens upon the street as do the large unroofed
monuments of Veius and Mamia. A blank marble tablet was
placed in the gable; the builder of the monument, who was
doubtless living at the time of the eruption, preferred to leave it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
to his heirs to add the memorial inscription, but the disaster
interfered with the fulfilment of his wishes. It was probably
intended to bury the cinerary urn either in the floor of the
niche or in the ground at the rear. The effect of the double
series of pilasters at the corners, placed one upon the other
without an intervening entablature, and of the fantastic stucco
decoration of the gable, is not unpleasing, although the designs
are far from classical; the tiles shown in the illustration are
modern. The inner wall is painted in red and black panels;
the vaulted ceiling, from which the stucco has now fallen, was
moulded to represent a shell.</p>

<p>Both the niche and the tomb of the Blue Glass Vase seem to
have belonged to the adjoining villa. The stucco decoration of
the villa in its main features is identical with that of the niche;
and the plot of ground behind the tombs is connected by a gateway
with a garden of the villa (12 on the plan), which was too
richly adorned to have been intended for the use of the occupants
of the inn. In the middle of the garden was a pavilion
supported by four mosaic columns (now in the Naples Museum),
similar to that in the garden of the villa of Diomedes, and to
others belonging to city houses. A mosaic fountain niche was
made in the rear wall facing the entrance from the street, and
in two corners were short columns on which were placed small
figures,&mdash;on one a boy with a hare, in marble, on the other a
frog of glazed terra cotta.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the garden seems to possess a distinctly sepulchral
character. Besides the entrances from the tombs and
from the street, there was a third, which led into a court of
the villa, with which the peristyle and living rooms were connected
by a passageway; in the corner of the court nearest the
garden, and facing the entrance from the street (15), was an
elaborate domestic shrine, dedicated, as shown by the symbolical
decoration, to Apollo, Bacchus, Hercules, and Mercury. The
relation of the garden with the living rooms of the villa was
only indirect; and we conclude that it was intended for gatherings
and sacred rites in honor of the dead. Relatives could
partake of the sepulchral banquet under the pavilion.</p>

<p>The tombs of the third group, as may be seen from <a href="#plate10">Plate X</a>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
form a stately series. The prevailing type is that which was in
vogue at the time of the destruction of the city&mdash;a high base,
with marble steps at the top leading up to a massive superstructure
in the form of an altar, faced with marble. The
burial plot was enclosed by a low wall. In the base of the tomb
was a sepulchral chamber, entered by a door in the rear or at
one side; it was now the custom for relatives to enter the burial
vault when they wished to pour libations on the ashes.</p>

<p>The first of the series (16 on the plan, seen in <a href="#plate10">Plate X</a> next
to the cypress) was unfinished at the time of the eruption.
Part of the marble veneering had not yet been added, the walls
of the sepulchral chamber were in the rough, and there were
no urns in the five niches designed for their reception. In the
burial plot surrounding the tomb, however, a marble bust
stone was found (<a href="#fig240">Fig. 240</a>) with the inscription, <i>Iunoni Tyches
Iuliae Augustae Vener[iae]</i>,&mdash;'To
the Genius of Tyche, slave
of Julia Augusta,&mdash;of the cult
of Venus.'</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 246px;"><a name="fig240" id="fig240"></a>
<img src="images/fig240.jpg" width="246" height="253" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 240.&mdash;Bust Stone of Tyche, slave of
Julia Augusta.</p>
</div>

<p>The reference is plainly to a
female slave of Livia, the wife
of Augustus; how her ashes
came to be deposited here it is
not worth while, in default of
information, to conjecture. In
sepulchral inscriptions of women
<i>Iunoni</i> sometimes takes the
place of <i>genio</i> in men's epitaphs.
Tyche was seemingly a member
of a sisterhood for the worship of Venus, to which, as to the
organization of the 'Servants of Mercury and Maia,' and of the
'Servants of Fortuna Augusta,' slaves were admitted.</p>

<p>The tomb of Umbricius Scaurus (17) is conspicuous by reason
of its size and noteworthy on account of its decoration.
The inscription on the front of the altar-shaped superstructure
gives interesting details in regard to the man the memory of
whom is here perpetuated: <i>A. Umbricio A. f. Men. Scauro, II
vir i. d.; huic decuriones locum monum[ento] et &#65944; ∞ ∞
in funere et statuam equestr[em in f]oro ponendam censuerunt.
Scaurus pater filio</i>,&mdash;'To the memory of Aulus Umbricius
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
Scaurus son of Aulus, of the tribe Menenia, duumvir with judiciary
authority. The city council voted the place for a monument
to this man and two thousand sesterces toward the cost
of the funeral; they voted also that an equestrian statue in his
honor should be set up in the Forum. Scaurus the father to
the memory of his son.'</p>

<p>Why these honors were conferred upon Scaurus, who probably
became a duumvir early in life and died soon after his
term of office, is not clear. The upper part of the base of the
tomb in front was adorned with stucco reliefs&mdash;now for the
most part gone&mdash;in which gladiatorial combats and a venatio
were depicted; but a painted inscription along the edge of one
of the scenes indicates that the show thus commemorated was
given by another man, <i>N. Fistius Ampliatus; Munere [N. Fis]ti
Ampliati die summo</i>. Perhaps the last two words mean that
'on the last day' the younger Scaurus, a relative or friend of
Ampliatus, shared the cost of the exhibition under some such
arrangement as that between Lucretius Valens and his son
(<a href="#Page_222">p. 222</a>). If this be the correct explanation, it is evident that
Scaurus could have given no shows in the Amphitheatre during
his duumvirate, else the father would have taken pains to mention
the fact in the inscription. His term of office may have
come after the year 59, when such exhibitions were prohibited at
Pompeii for ten years (<a href="#Page_220">p. 220</a>).</p>

<p>The gladiatorial scenes, if space permitted, would merit a
detailed presentation&mdash;they are so full of human interest.
Two gladiators are fighting on horseback, the rest on foot.
The vanquished with uplifted thumbs are mutely begging for
mercy. The plea of some of them is heeded by the populace;
in other groups we see the victor preparing to give the death
thrust. Beside each gladiator was painted his name, school,
and number of previous combats, as in a programme; and
letters were added to give the result of this fight. One combatant,
who was beaten and yet by the vote of the audience
permitted to live, died on the sand from his wounds. We see
him resting on one knee, faint from loss of blood; the letter M
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
beside his name, for <i>missus</i>, is followed by the death sign Θ, the
first letter of the Greek word for death, <span class="greek" title="THANATOS">ΘΑΝΑΤΟΣ</span>.</p>

<p>The animals shown in the venatio are mainly wild boars and
bears, but we recognize also a lion and a bull. Lions were doubtless
much more rarely seen in such exhibitions at Pompeii than
at Rome.</p>

<p>As more attention came to be given to the outward appearance
of tombs, less was bestowed upon the adornment of the
sepulchral chamber. So in the tomb of Scaurus the burial vault
is low, cramped, and with plain white walls. A massive pillar,
as in the tomb of the Istacidii, supports the vaulted ceiling. It
is pierced by two openings, forming four niches, two on each
side. Three of these, when the tomb was opened, were closed
by panes of glass, and there were traces of a curtain that hung
over the one opposite the entrance. There were fourteen other
niches in the walls at the sides.</p>

<p>No name is associated with the third tomb (18 on the plan)
which, as shown by <a href="#plate10">Plate X</a>, is simply a large cylinder of
masonry, the top of which probably had the shape of a truncated
cone; the material is brick, with a facing of white stucco
lined off to give the appearance of blocks of marble. The base
is square; the enclosing wall is adorned with miniature towers.
The structure illustrates in its simplest form the type of the
massive tomb, or mausoleum, found at Rome; we are at once
reminded of the imposing monument of Caecilia Metella on the
Appian Way, and of Hadrian's Mausoleum in the city.</p>

<p>A blank tablet was placed by the builder on the front of the
enclosing wall to receive an inscription after his death. The
heirs, however, preferred to put the memorial on the tomb itself,
where the place of an inscription is plainly seen, the slab itself
having disappeared. The sepulchral chamber is in the superstructure;
it was decorated with simple designs in the fourth
style on a white ground. There were only three niches, perhaps
for father, mother, and child; the urns were let into the
bottoms of the niches, as often in the Roman columbaria.</p>

<p>One of the miniature towers on the enclosing wall is ornamented
with a relief presenting a singular design; a woman in
mourning habit is laying a fillet on a skeleton reclining on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
heap of stones (<a href="#fig241">Fig. 241</a>). The scene may be interpreted as
symbolizing the grief of a mother for a dead son.</p>

<div class="figcenter p6"><a name="plate10" id="plate10"></a>
<img src="images/plate10.jpg" width="600" height="465" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PLATE X.&mdash;THE STREET OF TOMBS, LOOKING TOWARD THE HERCULANEUM GATE</p>
</div>

<p>There is only a simple bust stone in the burial lot (19) beyond
the round monument. Next comes the beautiful tomb of Calventius
Quietus (20), which may be seen in <a href="#plate10">Plate X</a>, as well as
the tomb of Naevoleia Tyche (22; further to the right). Between
these two is a walled enclosure (21) without a door, in
which are three bust stones. The largest stone bears the name
N. Istacidius Helenus; in front of one of the others a small jar was
set to receive offerings for the dead. On the front of the enclosing
wall is a tablet on which the names of N. Istacidius Januarius
and of Mesonia Satulla appear with
that of Helenus; they were all freedmen
of the Istacidii (<a href="#Page_412">p. 412</a>).</p>

<p>The monuments of Quietus and of
Tyche are the finest examples of the
altar type at Pompeii. Both are ornamented
in good taste, but the carvings
of the former are more delicate, while
the motives of the latter are more elaborate.
Quietus was a man of some prominence,
as we see from the epitaph: <i>C.
Calventio Quieto Augustali; huic ob
munificent[iam] decurionum decreto et populi conse[n]su bisellii
honor datus est</i>,&mdash;'To the memory of Gaius Calventius Quietus,
member of the Brotherhood of Augustus. On account of his
generosity the honor of a seat of double width was conferred
upon him by the vote of the city council and the approval of the
people.'</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 190px;"><a name="fig241" id="fig241"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 241.&mdash;Relief, symbolic of
grief for the dead.</p>
</div>

<p>At the Theatre and the Amphitheatre, Quietus had the privilege
of sitting on a bisellium, as if he were a member of
the city council. Below the inscription is a representation of
the 'seat of double width,' shown in <a href="#fig242">Fig. 242</a>. The square footstool
at the middle implies that the seat was intended for a single
person. The ends of the tomb were ornamented with finely
carved reliefs of the civic crown, which was made of oak leaves
and awarded to those who had saved the life of a Roman citizen
(<a href="#fig243">Fig. 243</a>). As the inscription does not record any deed of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
valor, it may be that the crown is used here merely as a decorative
device.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 346px;"><a name="fig242" id="fig242"></a>
<img src="images/fig242.jpg" width="346" height="378" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 242.&mdash;Front of the tomb of Calventius Quietus,
with bisellium.</p>
</div>

<p>Though the monument of Quietus was built in the last years
of the city, when such structures were generally provided with
sepulchral chambers,
it has no burial vault,
and the enclosing wall
is without a door. It
is perhaps a cenotaph,
a monument erected
in honor of a man
whose remains were
interred elsewhere; it
is also possible that
Quietus had no relatives
who wished to
have an accessible sepulchral
chamber in
order to make libations
to his ashes, and
that for this reason
the monument was
made solid, the urn
being buried in the earth underneath. The small turrets on the
enclosing wall were adorned with reliefs; among them Oedipus
solving the riddle of the Sphinx, and Theseus after the slaughter
of the Minotaur. The suggestion is obvious: he who is commemorated
here had solved the riddle of existence, had found
an exit from the labyrinth of life.</p>

<p>Around the front and sides of the tomb of Naevoleia Tyche
runs a border of acanthus arabesques, forming panels in which
reliefs are placed. The border in front is interrupted at the
middle of the upper side by the portrait of Tyche; the lower
half of the panel is devoted to a ceremonial scene in which offerings
appear to be made to the dead, while in the upper half,
under the portrait, we read the inscription: <i>Naevoleia L. lib[erta]
Tyche sibi et C. Munatio Fausto Aug[ustali] et pagano,
cui decuriones consensu populi bisellium ob merita eius decreverunt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
Hoc monimentum Naevoleia Tyche libertis suis libertabusq[ue]
et C. Munati Fausti viva fecit</i>,&mdash;'Naevoleia Tyche,
freedwoman of Lucius Naevoleius, for herself and for Gaius
Munatius Faustus, member of the Brotherhood of Augustus
and suburban official, to whom on account of his distinguished
services the city council, with the approval of the people, granted
a seat of double width. This monument Naevoleia Tyche built in
her lifetime also for the freedmen and freedwomen of herself and
of Gaius Munatius Faustus,' who was seemingly her husband.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig243" id="fig243"></a>
<img src="images/fig243.jpg" width="539" height="431" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 243.&mdash;End of the tomb of Naevoleia Tyche, with relief of a ship entering port;
beyond, end of the tomb of Calventius Quietus, with the civic crown.</p>
</div>

<p>The bisellium of Faustus is shown in one of the end panels;
in the other we see a ship sailing into port (<a href="#fig243">Fig. 243</a>). The carving
of the relief is bold, though crude; we see the sailors furling
the sail, as the vessel glides into still water. The scene is symbolical
of death,&mdash;the entrance of the soul after the storms of life
into a haven of rest. The thought is expressed by Cicero with
deep feeling in his essay on Old Age: 'As for myself, I find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
the ripening of life truly agreeable; the nearer I come to the
time of death, the more I feel like one who begins to see land
and knows that sometime he will enter the harbor after the long
voyage.'</p>

<p>The sepulchral chamber of this tomb has a large niche opposite
the entrance; the urn standing in it apparently contained
the cinerary remains of two persons, Tyche and Faustus. Other
urns were found in the smaller niches in the walls and on the
bench of masonry along the sides. Three were of glass, protected
by lead cases; one of them is shown in <a href="#fig244">Fig. 244</a>. They
contained ashes and fragments of bone, with remains of a liquid
mixture, which was shown by chemical analysis to have consisted
of water, wine, and oil. Lamps were found on
the bench, one for each urn, and there were
others in a corner; they were used on anniversary
days to light the chamber.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 244.&mdash;Cinerary

<p>The last monument consists of a walled enclosure,
with a table and couches of masonry
like those often found in the gardens of private
houses (<a href="#fig245">Fig. 245</a>). In front of the table
is a small round altar for libations. This was
a place for banquets in honor of the dead, <i>triclinium
funebre</i>; a tomb designed to serve the
convenience of the living, like the niche of Cerrinius
Restitutus and the benches of Veius and Mamia. The
walls were painted in the last style.</p>

<p>Over the entrance in front we read: <i>Cn. Vibrio Q. f. Fal. Saturnino
Callistus lib.</i>,&mdash;'To the memory of Gnaeus Vibrius Saturninus
son of Quintus, of the tribe Falerna; erected by his
freedman Callistus.' As Saturninus did not belong to the
tribe Menenia, he was very likely not a native of Pompeii.
His ashes were probably placed in an urn and buried in the
earth between the altar and the entrance.</p>

<p>There is every reason to suppose that the series of tombs
on the south side of the highway is continued beyond the villa
of Diomedes; but it has not yet been found possible to carry
the excavations further in that direction.</p>

<p>The tombs of the fourth group present no new types of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
design or construction. Several of them are of interest, however,
on account of peculiarities of arrangement. At the time
of the eruption two of the monuments (33, 35) were in process
of building; it is impossible to tell what form they were to have.
A third (36) had been commenced on a large scale, but apparently
the money of the heirs gave out, and little pyramids were
set up at the corners of the walled enclosure, the urns being
buried in the earth.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 245.&mdash;Sepulchral enclosure with triclinium funebre.</p>
</div>

<p>Two of the monuments were erected for children (40, 41).
They stand near together on the high ground in the angle
formed by the Vesuvius Road. They are small vaulted niches,
ornamented with reliefs in white stucco, most of which has fallen
off. The urn in each was placed in the earth under the bottom
of the niche, with a small pipe tile leading to the surface,
through which libations could be poured down upon it. A
tablet is set in the sustaining wall at the side of the street below
the larger niche (41), with the simple inscription, <i>N. Velasio
Grato, vix[it] ann. XII</i>,&mdash;'To the memory of Numerius Velasius
Gratus, who lived twelve years.' The inscription belonging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
to the other niche was even more simple, giving no first
name: <i>Salvius puer vixit annis VI</i>,&mdash;'The boy Salvius lived six
years.'</p>

<p>One tomb (34) is noteworthy on account of its door. This
has the appearance of a double door, but it is made of a single
slab of marble, and swings, like an ordinary Roman door, by
means of pivots which are fitted into sockets in the threshold
and lintel. It was also provided with a lock. The exterior
of the tomb was unfinished; the reticulate masonry still lacked
its facing of more costly material. The sepulchral chamber,
however, contained several cinerary urns; one of them, of
alabaster, was in a large niche facing the entrance, and a gold
seal ring, with the figure of a deer in an intaglio, was found
in it among the ashes and fragments of bone. There were
also several lamps, a small altar of terra cotta, and a few glass
perfume vials. Two amphorae, of the sort used for wine, stood
against the sides of the chamber; such were sometimes utilized
as repositories for ashes.</p>

<p>One of the volutes of the well preserved limestone tomb of
M. Alleius Luccius Libella (37) is seen in <a href="#plate10">Plate X</a>. The monument
has the shape of an altar, and is apparently solid. It was
erected by the widow, Alleia Decimilla, priestess of Ceres, in
memory of her husband, who was duumvir in 26 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>, and of
a son of the same name, who was a member of the city council
and died in his eighteenth year. The burial plot was given by
the city. As no opening was left in the monument, Decimilla
evidently planned to have her ashes deposited in another tomb,
perhaps that of her father's family.</p>

<p>The remaining four tombs are of the same type; the idea is
that of a temple, the columnar construction being suggested
not by projecting half-columns, as in the tomb of the Istacidii,
but by more or less prominent pilasters at the corners and on
the sides. Two of the tombs (38 and 39) stand where the
tongue of land between the highway and the Vesuvius Road
begins to descend to the level of the pavement.</p>

<p>The remains of the tomb of Ceius Labeo (38) are shown in
<a href="#plate10">Plate X</a> (in the foreground, at the left). The appearance of
this monument was somewhat like that of the Istacidii; there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
was a second story, the roof of which was supported entirely by
columns; between these, statues of members of the family were
placed, of both men and women, some of marble, others of tufa
coated with stucco. The base was ornamented with stucco
reliefs, which have almost entirely disappeared; above, in front,
were two portrait medallions.</p>

<p>The large sepulchral chamber can be seen in the plate. The
floor was more than six feet below the surface of the ground.
A vaulted niche in the rear wall was connected with the outside
by means of a small opening at the top, through which libations
could be poured or offerings dropped upon the urn below. In
the vicinity of the monument was found the inscription: <i>L. Ceio
L. f. Men. Labeoni iter[um] d. v. i. d. quinq[uennali] Menomachus
l[ibertus]</i>,&mdash;'To the memory of Lucius Ceius Labeo son
of Lucius, of the tribe Menenia, twice duumvir with judiciary
authority, also quinquennial duumvir; erected by his freedman,
Menomachus.'</p>

<p>There were bust stones in the plot belonging to this monument,
and also about the adjoining tomb (39); the names of
those whose ashes were deposited under the stones, in part, at
least, seem to have been painted upon the base of Labeo's tomb,
but they were illegible at the time of excavation. The adjoining
tomb (39) is without a name, but was built after that erected
in honor of Labeo.</p>

<p>The tombs at the end of the fourth group (42, 43) belong to
one household. In the sustaining wall along the highway a
sepulchral tablet of tufa is seen with the inscription: <i>Arriae M.
f. Diomedes l[ibertus] sibi suis</i>,&mdash;'Diomedes, a freedman, for
Arria, daughter of Marcus Arrius, for himself and for his
family.' On the elevation directly above is his tomb, the end
of which is seen in <a href="#plate10">Plate X</a> (in the foreground). It bears the
inscription: <i>M. Arrius Ↄ. l. Diomedes sibi suis memoriae, magister
pag[i] Aug[usti] Felic[is] suburb[ani]</i>,&mdash;'Marcus Arrius
Diomedes, freedman of Arria, magistrate of the suburb Pagus
Augustus Felix, in memory of himself and his family.'</p>

<p>The abbreviation Ↄ. l. takes the place of <i>Gaiae libertus</i>, 'freedman
of Gaia,' the letter C, which stands for Gaius, being reversed;
Gaia is used, as in legal formulas, to show that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
person referred to is a woman. The slave Diomedes, after receiving
his freedom, was entitled to the use of the family name,
and was known as Marcus Arrius Diomedes. His mistress, as
Roman ladies generally, was called not by a first name, but by
the feminine form of the family name, Arria, which was as
plainly suggested to a Roman reading the name Arrius followed
by the symbol as if it had been written in full.</p>

<p>On the front of the tomb we observe in stucco relief two
bundles of rods, <i>fasces</i>, with axes, having reference to the official
position of Diomedes as a magistrate of a suburb. The axes
are quite out of place. Suburban officers did not have the
'power of life and death'; the lictors of such magistrates carried
bundles of rods without axes. The vain display of authority
reminds one of the pompous petty official held up to ridicule
by Horace in his Journey to Brundisium; it suggests also the
rods and axes painted on the posts at the entrance of the dining
room of Trimalchio, in Petronius's novel. The tomb was constructed
without a burial vault, but there were two bust stones
near by with names of freedmen of Diomedes.</p>

<p>The monument to Arria (43) lies further back; it fronts on
the Vesuvius Road. Diomedes found a way to reconcile happily
his own love of display with his duty to his former mistress; he
built a larger monument for her, but chose for his own the more
conspicuous position. The small sepulchral chamber of Arria's
tomb contained nothing of interest and is now walled up.

<h3><a name="chap_li" id="chap_li">CHAPTER LI</a><br />

<span class="s08"><i>BURIAL PLACES NEAR THE NOLA, STABIAN, AND
NOCERA GATES</i></span></h3>

<p>No part of the highway leading from the Nola Gate has yet
been excavated. In the year 1854, however, excavations were
made for a short distance along the city wall near this gate, and
thirty-six cinerary urns were found buried in the earth. In or
near them were perfume vials of terra cotta with a few of glass.
Here in the pomerium, the strip of land along the outside of the
walls, which was left vacant for religious as well as practical
reasons, the poor were permitted to bury the ashes of their dead
without cost. In some cases the place of the urn was indicated
by a bust stone; often the spot was kept in memory merely by
cutting upon the outside of the city wall the name of the person
whose ashes rested here.</p>

<p>There was another cemetery of the poor a short distance
southwest of the Amphitheatre, south of the modern highway.
It lay along a road which branched off from the highway leading
to Stabiae and ran east in the direction of Nocera. Sepulchral
remains were found here in 1755-57, and again in 1893-94,
when further explorations were made. They consist of cinerary
urns, buried in the earth, with small glass perfume vials in or
near them, and a bust stone to mark the spot. A few of the
stones are of marble and bear a name; the great majority are
roughly carved out of blocks of lava, and if a name was painted
on the front it has disappeared.</p>

<p>Of special significance, in connection with these burial places,
is the arrangement for making offerings to the dead. In order
that libations might be poured directly upon the cinerary urns,
these were connected with the surface of the ground by means
of tubes. In one instance a lead pipe ran from above into an
opening made for it in the top of the lead case inclosing an urn.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
More often the connection was made by means of round tiles;
in the case of one urn, three tiles were joined together, making a
tube five feet long. The upper end of the libation tube did not
project from the ground, but was placed just below the surface
and covered with a flat stone; over this was a thin layer of
earth, which the relatives would remove on the feast days of the
dead. Pagan antiquity was never able to dissociate the spirit of
the dead from the place of interment; the worship of ancestors
was in no small degree the product of local associations.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of these remains is a sepulchral monument of
modest dimensions, which, as we learn from the tablet over the
entrance, was erected by Marcus Petasius Dasius in memory of
his two sons, Severus and Communis, and of a freedwoman
named Vitalis. There was no floor in the burial chamber;
the urns were placed in the earth and marked by bust stones,
among which was one set up for Dasius himself, with the
initials M. P. D.</p>

<p>The Stabian Road has been excavated for but a short distance
near the gate. The only monuments completely cleared are two
large, semicircular benches, like those of Veius and Mamia
(<a href="#Page_409">p. 409</a>). At the rear of each is a small sepulchral enclosure in
which the urns were buried. The memorial tablet belonging
to the monument nearest the gate has disappeared, but two
boundary stones at the corners of the lot bear the inscription:
<i>M. Tullio M. f. ex d[ecurionum] d[ecreto</i>],&mdash;'To Marcus Tullius
son of Marcus, in accordance with a vote of the city council.'
The Tullius named was perhaps the builder of the temple of
Fortuna Augusta (<a href="#Page_132">p. 132</a>).</p>

<p>The inscription of the second bench, like that of Mamia, is
cut in large letters on the back of the seat: <i>M. Alleio Q. f.
Men. Minio, II v. i. d.; locus sepulturae publice datus ex d. d.</i>,&mdash;'To
the memory of Marcus Alleius Minius son of Marcus, of
the tribe Menenia, duumvir with judiciary authority. The place
of burial was given in the name of the city by vote of the municipal
council.'</p>

<p>A third bench, close to the second, lies under a modern house
and has not been uncovered. Further from the gate a rectangular
seat, probably belonging to the same series of monuments,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
was discovered in 1854, it was built in memory of a certain
Clovatius, duumvir, as shown by a fragment of an inscription
that came to light at the same time. From still another
tomb are reliefs with gladiatorial combats, now in the Naples
Museum.</p>

<p>With the exception of those near the Herculaneum Gate, the
most important tombs yet discovered at Pompeii are in a group
beyond the Amphitheatre, excavated in 1886-87. They are six
in number, and lie close together on both sides of a road which
ran east from the Nocera Gate, bending slightly to the north
(<a href="#fig246">Fig. 246</a>). This road was not in use in the last years of the
city; the stones of the pavement and sidewalk had been removed.
The monuments, however, were large and stately,
erected by people of means, and the ruins are characteristic and
impressive. The tombs were built of common materials, stucco
being used on exposed surfaces instead of marble. The simplicity
of construction, and the shapes of the letters in the election
notices and other inscriptions painted on them, suggest a
relatively early date, which is confirmed by the age of the coins
found in the urns; the
monuments belong to the
early decades of the Empire.</p>

</div>

<p>The first tomb at the
right (No. 1 on the plan)
was built in the form of
a commemorative arch,
with pilasters at the corners.
Above was a low
cylinder surmounted by
a truncated cone, on which
stood a terminal member
in the shape of a pine cone,
found near by. The cinerary
urn was buried in the
earth below an opening in
the floor of the passage under the arch (shown in the plan). No
name appears in connection with this monument.

<p class="caption">Fig. 247.&mdash;View of two tombs east of the Amphitheatre.<br />
That at the left is No. 3 on the plan; the next is No. 4.</p>
</div>

<p>Another monument of the arch type, that of Mancius Diogenes,
is seen on the opposite side of the street (5; <a href="#fig248">Fig. 248</a>).
The structure is shallow, the vaulted opening low. On the top
of the arch were three niches, in which stood three travertine
statues; two of these, both of women, have been preserved,
and are of indifferent workmanship. A marble tablet was
placed in front, over the vault, with the inscription, <i>P. Mancio
P. l[iberto] Diogeni ex testamento arbitratu Manciae P. l[ibertae]
Dorinis</i>,&mdash;'To the memory of Publius Mancius Diogenes, freedman
of Publius Mancius; (the monument was erected) in accordance
with the terms of his will, under the direction of Mancia
Doris, freedwoman of Publius Mancius.'</p>

<p>There is a curious ambiguity in this inscription; we cannot
tell whether Doris, seemingly the wife of Diogenes, was manumitted
by the Publius Mancius who gave him his freedom, or
by Diogenes himself after he had gained his freedom and
was entitled to use the name Publius Mancius. Four bust
stones stood in front of the tomb and two at the rear,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
arranged as indicated on the plan; those in front are seen in
our illustration.</p>

<p>The tomb at the left of that just described (4; <a href="#fig247">Fig. 247</a>) is of
interest as showing the result of an attempt to blend the arch
type with that of the temple. A passage roofed with a flat
vault runs through the middle of the first story. The second
story had the appearance of a diminutive temple with four
Corinthian columns in front. The niche representing the cella
was of the full width of the tomb, and occupied two thirds of
the depth; the other third was given to the portico. Four
statues of tufa coated with stucco that were found here probably
stood under the portico or in the intercolumniations, where
they would best be seen from below; three were statues of men,
the fourth of a woman.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the five bust stones in the vaulted passage
is indicated on the plan. The three nearest the street
entrance bear the name of a freedman, <i>L. Caesius L. l. Logus</i>,&mdash;'Lucius
Caesius Logus, freedman of Lucius Caesius,' and of
Titia Vesbina and Titia Optata, both evidently freedwomen
manumitted by a lady named Titia. We are probably safe in
assuming that the two inmost stones, without names, are those
of Caesius and Titia, husband and wife, who gave Logus,
Vesbina, and Optata their freedom, and built the monument.
It was not necessary to place the names of the builders upon
the commemorative stones, because they were doubtless given
in the memorial tablet in front, which has disappeared. Coins
of Augustus and Tiberius were found in the urns.</p>

<p>One tomb (2) has the form of a niche, resembling those of
the two children near the end of the Street of Tombs (<a href="#Page_425">p. 425</a>),
but larger and more costly than they. The corners are embellished
with three-quarter columns, which have Doric flutings
and composite capitals. On the walls at the entrance we see,
modelled in stucco, doorposts with double doors swung back.
Two marble bust stones, the places of which are indicated on
the plan, show where the urns of the two most important members
of the family, Apuleius and his wife Veia, were buried;
their names doubtless appeared in an inscription on the front
of the monument. In one of the urns was found a coin of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
Tiberius of the year 10 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> The other was enclosed in a lead
case, and a lead libation tube was extended from the ashes
through both covers to the surface.</p>

<p>The names of Apuleius and Veia are obtained from two other
bust stones, in front of the niche. One reads, <i>Festae Apulei
f[iliae] vix[it] ann[os] XVII</i>,&mdash;'To the memory of Festa,
daughter of Apuleius, who lived seventeen years.' The other
has simply [<i>C]onviva Veiaes vix. an. XX</i>,&mdash;'Conviva, slave of
Veia, lived twenty years.' An as of the time of the Republic
was found in the urn of Conviva; and a square tile, the upper
end of which was closed by a piece of marble, served as a libation
tube for the urn of Festa.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig248" id="fig248"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 248.&mdash;Two other tombs east of the Amphitheatre.<br />
Nos. 5, 6 on the plan.</p>
</div>

<p>The two remaining tombs are of the temple type, one (3;
<a href="#fig247">Fig. 247</a>) having pilasters at the corners, the other half-columns
at the corners and on the sides (6). The first has a vaulted
sepulchral chamber, entered from the rear. On the inside of
the wall next the street are three low niches, the top of which
is nearly on a level with the sidewalk; each of them contained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
an urn. Directly over the inner niches, in the outside
of the wall and opening toward the street, are three other
niches, shown in the illustration, in the bottom of which were
libation tubes leading to the urns below. Relatives could
thus pour their offerings of wine or oil upon the urns without
entering the sepulchral chamber. Lava bust stones were
placed against the back of the outer niches. The hair on
one of them is treated in a manner to indicate that a woman
is represented. The entrance of the tomb was closed by a
large block of lava. On account of the arrangement for offering
libations from the outside, it was not necessary to make
the burial vault easy of access.</p>

<p>The entrance to the other tomb (6; <a href="#fig248">Fig. 248</a>) was in front,
and closed by a door of limestone. It led, not to a sepulchral
chamber, but to a stairway by which one ascended to the second
story. Here statues were placed, but the exact form of the
upper part cannot be determined. The finding of five tufa
capitals suggests that the second story may have been a columnar
structure, like that of the tomb of the Istacidii; when the
excavations are carried further east enough other fragments
will perhaps be found to make a complete restoration possible.
One of the statues is of a man holding a roll of papyrus in his
hand, with a round manuscript case, <i>scrinium</i>, at his feet.</p>

<p>Among the inscriptions painted on these tombs were two,
relating to gladiatorial combats, which have already been mentioned
(<a href="#Page_221">p. 221</a>). One of the election notices, oddly enough,
refers to a candidate for an office in Nuceria: <i>L. Munatium
Caeserninum Nuceriae II vir. quinq. v. b. o. v. f.</i> (for <i>duumvirum
quinquennalem, virum bonum, oro vos, facite</i>),&mdash;'Make Lucius
Caeserninus quinquennial duumvir of Nuceria, I beg of you,
he's a good man.' As long as the relations of the Pompeians
and Nucerians were friendly, the highway between the two
towns was doubtless much travelled by the citizens of both
places.</p>

<p>If the visitor pauses to think of the religious feeling which
the ancients manifested generally in relation to their burial
places, it gives somewhat of a shock to see notices even of a
semi-public character painted in bright red letters upon tombs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
All such inscriptions, however, are surpassed in ludicrous incongruity
with the purpose of the monument by the following
advertisement regarding a stray horse: <i>Equa siquei aberavit
cum semuncis honerata a. d. VII Kal. Septembres</i> (corrected into
<i>Decembres</i>), <i>convenito Q. Deciu[m] Q. l. Hilarum ... L. l. ...
chionem, citra pontem Sarni fundo Mamiano</i>,&mdash;'If anybody lost
a mare with a small pack-saddle, November 25, let him come and
see Quintus Decius Hilarus, freedman of Quintus Decius, or ...
(the name is illegible), freedman of Lucius, on the estate of the
Mamii, this side of the bridge over the Sarno.' The two freedmen
were very likely in partnership, working a farm belonging
to the family, one representative of which we have already met,
Mamia the priestess (<a href="#Page_410">p. 410</a>).</p>

<p>A more serious desecration of burial places, after offerings to
the dead ceased to be made by relatives, or a family became
extinct, was probably not uncommon. Different families had
different gods, and those of one household were quite independent
of those of another. Ordinarily a man had no reason
to fear or respect the gods of his neighbor; notwithstanding
the associations of worship connected with tombs, the general
feeling toward them was very different from that manifested
toward temples, where local divinities or the great gods were
worshipped. The most stringent regulations of the emperors
could not prevent the ransacking of the tombs about Rome for
objects of value, and the removal of their materials of construction
for building purposes. The superstructure of two of the
monuments near the Herculaneum Gate had disappeared apparently
before the destruction of the city, and of the tomb of
Porcius only the core remained.

<h2>PART V<br />

POMPEIAN ART</h2>

<h3 class="chap1">CHAPTER LII<br />

<span class="s08"><i>ARCHITECTURE</i></span></h3>

<p>In the preceding pages the principal buildings of Pompeii
have been described, and reference has been made to many
works of art. We shall now offer a few observations of a more
general nature in regard to the remains of architecture, sculpture,
and painting.</p>

<p>The different periods in the architectural history of the city
have been defined in a previous chapter. The most significant
of these, from every point of view, is that which we have called
the Tufa Period, which corresponds roughly with the second
century <span class="s08">B.C.</span> Its importance is chiefly due to the fact that it
records for us a phase of architectural development, a style, of
which only slight traces are found elsewhere,&mdash;in the East. It
is the last offshoot of untrammelled Hellenistic art in the field of
construction; the architecture of the following period was still
derived from Hellenistic sources, but was dominated by Roman
conceptions, and received from Rome the impulse that determined
the direction of its development. The remains of the
Tufa Period at Pompeii furnish materials for a missing chapter
in the history of architecture.</p>

<p>As we have seen, the stone preferred in this period for all
purposes was the gray tufa. Where used for columns, pilasters,
and entablatures, it was covered with stucco; in plain walls it
appeared in its natural color. Unfortunately, the covering of
stucco is preserved in only a few cases; the best example is presented
by an Ionic capital in the first peristyle of the house of the
Faun. The stucco was generally white, but color was sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
employed, as in the Corinthian columns and pilasters of the
exedra in the same house, which are painted a deep wine red.</p>

<p>No other period of Pompeian art shows in an equal degree
the impress of a single characteristic and self-consistent style,
alike in public buildings, temples, and private houses, in the
interior decoration as well as in the treatment of exteriors.
The wall decoration of the first style is simply the adaptation
of tufa construction to decorative use. The motives are identical.
The forms are the same, but these naturally appear in a
freer handling upon interior walls, the effect being heightened
by the use or imitation of slabs of marble of various colors.</p>

<p>This style throughout gives the impression of roominess and
largeness. It is monumental, especially when viewed in contrast
with the later architecture of Pompeii. No building erected
after the city became a Roman colony can be compared, for
ample dimensions and spatial effects, with the Basilica. In the
same class are the temples of Jupiter and Apollo, with the impressive
two-storied colonnades enclosing the areas on which
they stand; the contrast with the later temples, as those of
Fortuna Augusta and Vespasian, is striking. All the more important
houses of this period are monumental in design and proportions,
with imposing entrances, large and lofty atriums, and
high doors opening upon the atrium; the shops in front also
were high, and in two stories.</p>

<p>In point of detail, the architecture of the Tufa Period reveals
less of strength and symmetry than its stately proportions and
modest material would lead us to expect. The ornamentation
is a debased descendant of the Greek. It is characterized by
superficial elegance, together with an apparent striving after
simplicity and an ill-concealed poverty of form and color.
Though the ornamental forms still manifest fine Greek feeling,
they lack delicacy of modelling and vigor of expression. They
are taken from Greek religious architecture, but all appreciation
of the three orders as distinct types, each suited for a different
environment, has disappeared. In consequence, we often find
a mixture of the orders, a blending of Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian
elements; and still more frequently do we meet with a
marked departure from the original proportions.

<p class="caption">Fig. 249.&mdash;Four-faced Ionic capital. Portico of the
Forum Triangulare.</p>
</div>

<p>Thus in the court of the temple of Apollo and in the first
peristyle of the house of the Faun we see Ionic columns supporting
a Doric entablature; in the house of the Black Wall,
Doric columns with an Ionic entablature. The Doric architrave,
contrary to rule, appears
divided into two
stripes, not only in the
colonnade of the Forum,
where the stripes
represent a difference
of material, but also in
the house of the Faun,
where the architrave is
represented as composed
of single blocks
reaching from column
to column (<a href="#Page_51">p. 51</a>). In
the Palaestra (<a href="#Page_165">p. 165</a>), and in many private houses, the Doric
column was lengthened, in a way quite out of harmony with the
original conception, in order to make it conform to the prevailing
desire for height and slender proportions. The shaft nowhere
appears with the pronounced entasis and strong diminution
characteristic of the type, and the capital has lost the breadth
and graceful outline of the Greek Doric.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 250.&mdash;Capital of pilaster.

</div>

<p>The Ionic columns in the cella of the temple of Jupiter (<a href="#Page_65">p.
65</a>) are of the Greek type, with volutes on two sides; elsewhere
we find only the so-called Roman Ionic,
with four volutes, a type that appears in
several well defined and pleasing examples.
One of these, a capital from the
portico at the entrance of the Forum
Triangulare, is shown in <a href="#fig249">Fig. 249</a>. The
deep incisions of the egg-and-dart pattern,
which give the egg almost the
appearance of a little ball, is characteristic;
it is found only at Pompeii, and there not after the Tufa
Period. A still freer handling of the Ionic is seen in the capital
of a pilaster in the casa del duca d'Aumale (<a href="#fig250">Fig. 250</a>).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span></p>

<p>The Corinthian capital appears in the usual forms, but the
projecting parts are shallow, on account of the lack of resisting
qualities in the stone. The best examples are the capitals of the
columns and pilasters of the exedra in the house of the Faun.
The workmanship here is fine, the realistic treatment of the
acanthus leaves being especially noteworthy. An interesting
series of variations from the normal type is seen in the capitals
of the pilasters at house entrances; we have already met with
a striking example of this series, ornamented with projecting
busts of human figures (<a href="#fig178">Fig. 178</a>). The design is often so fantastic
that the essential character of the Corinthian capital seems
entirely lost sight of.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig251" id="fig251"></a>
<img src="images/fig251.jpg" width="533" height="271" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 251.&mdash;Altar in the court of the temple of Zeus Milichius.</p>
</div>

<p>The entablatures of the temples built in the Tufa Period, as
of those erected in later times, have all perished. The entablatures
of the colonnades, however, are at least in part well preserved
in a number of instances, and are of two types, the
Doric, characterized by the use of triglyphs, and the Ionic, distinguished
by the dentils of the cornice.</p>

<p>Both types are found also in the wall decoration, the first
rarely, the second very frequently. On the altar of the temple
of Zeus Milichius, which is of tufa coated with stucco, the Doric
entablature appears in association with the characteristic decoration
of the first style, the imitation of large blocks of marble;
on the top are terminal volutes of Ionic origin, as generally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
upon Roman altars and altar-shaped tombs (<a href="#fig251">Fig. 251</a>). On
walls decorated in the first style, however, only Ionic entablatures
are seen,&mdash;sometimes even twice upon the same wall, as
in the example shown in <a href="#fig122">Fig. 122</a>. From this we infer that in
the temple construction of the Tufa Period, the simple and
elegant Ionic entablature was the prevailing type.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding its free adaption of Greek forms, the Tufa
Period availed itself very sparingly of polychrome decoration
for architectural members. The stucco of the Ionic capital in
the house of the Faun is white; white likewise are most of the
capitals of pilasters found in the houses, and also the numerous
Ionic cornices on the walls.</p>

<p>There are, nevertheless, scanty traces of the application of
color. In the wall decoration of the house of Sallust we find a
Doric frieze with the metopes painted red. The frieze under
the Ionic cornices on the walls also is usually made prominent
with color,&mdash;red, yellow, or blue; and a red frieze is seen in
the peristyle of the house of the Black Wall, above the pilasters
of the garden wall. The lower stripe of the painted architrave
in the house of the Faun, already referred to, is yellow.</p>

<p>It seems probable that in some cases color was applied to the
projecting figures of the peculiar capitals used in houses; at
the time of excavation, traces of coloring were distinctly seen
upon those belonging to the alae of the house of Epidius Rufus
(<a href="#Page_309">p. 309</a>). The exposed capitals at the entrances (<a href="#fig178">Fig. 178</a>), if
originally painted, would naturally have lost all traces of the
coloring before the destruction of the city, unless it were from
time to time renewed. Notwithstanding these exceptions, we
must conclude that the stucco coating upon public buildings and
temples was generally white, in the case of capitals and cornices
as well as of the shafts of columns and outside walls; colors
were used to a limited extent, upon friezes and perhaps other
parts of entablatures.</p>

<p>The architectural remains of the half century immediately
succeeding the Tufa Period, between the founding of the Roman
colony at Pompeii and the establishment of the Empire, present
nothing specially characteristic outside of the peculiarities of
construction mentioned in <a href="#chap_vi">Chap. 6</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span></p>

<p>In the earlier years of the Empire, the Pompeians, as Roman
subjects everywhere, commenced to build temples and colonnades
of marble. The style, which was distinctively Roman, can
be studied to better advantage elsewhere; the remains at Pompeii
are relatively unimportant, and the chief points of interest
have been mentioned in connection with our study of individual
buildings.</p>

<li>B. Modified Corinthian.</li>
<li>C. Fantastic Corinthian.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The stylistic development of Roman architecture in the next
period,&mdash;the gradual transition from the simplicity of the Augustan
Age to the more elaborate ornamentation of the Flavian
Era,&mdash;is marked by two opposing tendencies, one conservative,
holding to the traditions of marble construction, the other reactionary.
The latter tendency manifests itself so strongly at
Pompeii that it merits special comment.</p>

<p>First in the East, it appears, men wearied of seeing the ornamental
forms of the Greek religious architecture repeated over
and over again in every kind of building, and attempted to
break away from them entirely. The reaction reached Italy in
the earlier years of the Empire, and began to exert an influence
upon ornamental forms, especially of domestic architecture, at
the time when the third style of wall decoration was coming
into vogue.</p>

<p>At Pompeii, this revolt from tradition affected not only the
ornamentation of private houses, but also that of public buildings,
as the Stabian Baths, and even of temples, as those of
Apollo and Isis, rebuilt after the earthquake of the year 63.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
Greek forms were replaced by fantastic designs of every sort,
worked in stucco. The capitals of columns and pilasters retained
a semblance of Doric and Corinthian types, but were
adorned with motives from many sources; the variety of form
and treatment can best be appreciated
by inspecting the examples shown in
our illustrations (<a href="#fig242">Figs. 242</a>, <a href="#fig253">253</a>, <a href="#fig254">254</a>).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 186px;"><a name="fig253" id="fig253"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 253.&mdash;Capital of pilaster,

</div>

<p>The entablatures no longer retained
the ancient division of architrave, frieze,
and cornice, but were made to represent
a single broad stripe, sometimes, however,
with a projecting cornice; this
stripe was ornamented with stucco reliefs,
and was frequently painted in
bright colors. Sometimes the decorative
theme is taken from a vine, as in the entablature of the
portico in front of the temple of Isis (<a href="#fig080">Fig. 80</a>) and that of the
peristyle of the house of the Vettii (<a href="#fig161">Fig. 161</a>). In some cases
the stripe is divided into vertical sections; the broad sections correspond
with the intercolumniations, the narrow ones with the
spaces above the columns; and the ornamental design is varied
accordingly, as in the palaestra of the Stabian Baths (<a href="#Page_198">p. 198</a>),
the court of the temple of Apollo (<a href="#fig031">Fig. 31</a>), and the peristyle
of the house of the Silver Wedding. In many instances the
background is white, frequently part of the details of ornament
as well; but colors were freely used, particularly red, blue, and
yellow, in all parts of the entablature.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig254" id="fig254"></a>
<img src="images/fig254.jpg" width="524" height="145" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 254.&mdash;Capitals of pilasters, showing free adaptations of the Corinthian type.</p>
</div>

<p>The lower third of the columns also was painted a bright red
or yellow&mdash;a treatment that would have been abhorrent to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
taste of the Tufa Period. The desire for variety and brilliancy
of color increased, and was more pronounced in the years immediately
preceding the eruption than at any previous time.</p>

<p>Consistently with this change in the standard of taste in regard
to details, the Pompeians no longer had pleasure in the
ample dimensions of the olden time. Houses were not now
built with high rooms, great doorways, and lofty columns as
in the Tufa Period. The rooms were smaller and lower, and
also, we may add, more homelike. But curiously enough, the
columns were often made thick as well as short, doubtless
in order to afford more space for the display of color on the
capitals and the lower part of the shaft.</p>

<p>Roman public and religious architecture in most cities still
adhered to the forms of marble construction, a suggestion of
which we find in the white walls of the temple of Isis; but the
lower third of the columns in the colonnade about this temple
was painted red, and the entablature was no doubt ornamented
with colored designs, as was that of the temple of Apollo. The
best preserved example of this last phase of Pompeian architectural
ornamentation is in the semicircular vaulted niche at the
right of the Street of Tombs.</p>

<p>Thus we see accomplished at Pompeii, in less than two centuries,
a complete revolution in matters of taste, so far as relates
to architecture. An entirely new feeling has been developed.
The beauty of contour and of symmetrical proportion found in
the Greek architecture had no charm for the Pompeian of the
later time; its place had been usurped by a different form of
beauty, that produced by the use of a variety of brilliant colors in
association with forms that were intricate, and often grotesque.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LIII<br />

<span class="s08"><i>SCULPTURE</i></span></h3>

<p>The open squares and public buildings of Pompeii were
peopled with statues. The visitor who walked about the Forum
in the years immediately preceding the eruption, saw on all
sides the forms of the men of past generations who had rendered
service to the city, as well as those of men of his own
time.</p>

<p>Besides the five colossal images of emperors and members of
the imperial families, places were provided in the Forum for
between seventy and eighty life size equestrian statues; and
behind each of these was room for a standing figure. Whether
all the places were occupied cannot now be determined, but
from the sepulchral inscription of Umbricius Scaurus (<a href="#Page_418">p. 418</a>) it
is clear that as late as the time of Claudius or Nero, there was
yet room for another equestrian figure. Statues were placed
also in the Forum Triangulare and occasionally at the sides of
the streets.</p>

<p>In the portico of the Macellum were twenty-five statues; the
sanctuary of the City Lares contained eight, while the portico
of the Eumachia building furnished places for twenty-one. But
only one of the hundreds of statues erected in honor of worthy
citizens has been preserved, that of Holconius Rufus, the rebuilder
of the Large Theatre; the figure was dressed in the uniform
of a military tribune, and stood on Abbondanza Street
near the Stabian Baths. With this should be classed the portrait
statues in the temple of Fortuna (<a href="#Page_131">p. 131</a>), and those of
Octavia (<a href="#fig038">Fig. 38</a>), Marcellus (<a href="#fig039">Fig. 39</a>), and Eumachia.</p>

<p>The statue of Eumachia is an interesting example of the
ordinary portrait sculpture of the Early Empire (<a href="#fig255">Fig. 255</a>).
The pose is by no means ungraceful, the treatment of the
drapery is modest and effective. The tranquil and thoughtful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
face is somewhat idealized, and without offensive emphasis of
details. The statue is not a masterpiece; nevertheless, it gives
us a pleasant impression of the lady whose generosity placed
the fullers under obligation,
and affords an insight
into the artistic
resources of the city.</p>

<p>A number of portrait
statues belonging to sepulchral
monuments were
found when the tombs
east of the Amphitheatre
were excavated (<a href="#chap_li">Chap. 51</a>).
Most of them are of tufa
covered with stucco; the
rest are of fine-grained
limestone. From the aesthetic
point of view they
are valueless.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 317px;"><a name="fig255" id="fig255"></a>
<img src="images/fig255.jpg" width="317" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 255.&mdash;Statue of the priestess Eumachia.</p>
</div>

<p>Sculptured portraits of
a different type were set
up in private houses. Relatives,
freedmen, and even
slaves sometimes placed
at the rear of the atrium,
near the entrance of the
tablinum, a herm of the
master of the house. At
each side of the square
pillar supporting the bust,
there was usually an arm-like
projection (seen on
the herm of Cornelius Rufus, <a href="#fig121">Fig. 121</a>), on which garlands were
hung upon birthdays and other anniversary occasions. Both the
herm of Rufus and that of Vesonius Primus previously mentioned
(<a href="#Page_396">p. 396</a>) are of marble; the head belonging to the herm of Sorex
(<a href="#Page_176">p. 176</a>) is of bronze.</p>

<p>The most striking of the portrait herms is that of Lucius
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
Caecilius Jucundus (<a href="#fig256">Fig. 256</a>), which was set up in duplicate, for
the sake of symmetrical arrangement, in the atrium of his house
on Stabian Street. The pillar is of marble; the dedication reads
<i>Genio L[ucii] nostri Felix
l[ibertus</i>],&mdash;'Felix, freedman,
to the Genius of our Lucius.'</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 283px;"><a name="fig256" id="fig256"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 256.&mdash;Portrait herm of Caecilius Jucundus.</p>
</div>

<p>The bust, of bronze, is modelled
with realistic vigor.
There is no attempt to soften
the prominent and almost repulsive
features by idealization.
We see the Pompeian
auctioneer just as he was, a
shrewd, alert, energetic man,
with somewhat of a taste for
art, and more for the good
things of life,&mdash;a man who
would bear watching in a
financial transaction.</p>

<p>Houses were adorned also
with heads and busts of famous
men of the past,&mdash;poets,
philosophers, and statesmen.
An extensive collection of historical
portraits was discovered
at Herculaneum, but
Pompeii thus far has not
yielded many examples. In
a room in one of the houses
was found a group of three
marble heads, about one half
life size, representing Epicurus, Demosthenes, and apparently
the Alexandrian poet Callimachus, whose works were particularly
valued in the time of the Early Empire. The identification of the
third head is not certain, but whether Callimachus or some other
poet is intended, the group reveals the direction of the owner's literary
tastes; he was interested in philosophy, oratory, and poetry.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span></p>

<p>Two portrait busts of distinguished men, which evidently
belong together, were found in another house, laid one side.
In the Naples Museum they bore the names of the Younger Brutus
and Pompey, but both identifications are erroneous; the features
in neither case agree with the representations upon coins.
The faces, as shown by the physiognomy and the treatment of
the hair, are those of Romans of the end of the Republic or the
beginning of the Empire. Recently a new identification has
been proposed which has much
in its favor. It rests chiefly
upon the resemblance of one
of the busts to the mosaic portrait
of Virgil, discovered in
1896 at Susa, in Africa. The
full, round face of the other
agrees very well with what we
know of the appearance of
Horace. It may be that we
have here a pair of poets, the
two most prominent of the Augustan
Age.</p>

<p>Frequently the gardens of
the peristyles, as those of the
houses of the Vettii and of Lucretius,
were profusely adorned
with sculptures of all kinds.
We find in them statuettes,
herms, small figures of animals,
and diminutive groups. Figures
derived from the myths of the bacchic cycle, Bacchus,
Silenus, satyrs, and bacchantes, are particularly common. The
artistic value is slight; among the best examples is the double
bust, with Bacchus on one side and a bacchante on the other,
found in the garden of the house of the Vettii (<a href="#fig257">Fig. 257</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 271px;"><a name="fig257" id="fig257"></a>
<img src="images/fig257.jpg" width="271" height="410" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 257.&mdash;Double bust, Bacchus and bacchante.
Garden of the house of the Vettii.</p>
</div>

<p>Characteristic among these sculptures are the figures designed
for the adornment of fountains; a number of them are exhibited
in the Museum at Naples. Bacchic figures are met with most
frequently. A good example is the marble Silenus in the garden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
of the house of Lucretius; the water spurts from the opening
in the wineskin which the old man carries. The design of the
small bronze satyr in the peristyle of the house of the Centenary
is more pleasing; an opening in the wineskin, held under the
left arm, cast a jet against the outstretched right hand in such
a way that the water was thrown back upon the satyr's body.</p>

<p>Fountains were adorned also with genre groups and animal
forms. We have already noticed the two bronze groups in the
peristyle of the house of the Vettii, each representing a boy
holding a duck, from the bill of which sprang a jet of water
(<a href="#fig162">Fig. 162</a>). The largest collection of animal forms was about
the basin in the middle peristyle of the house of the Citharist;
it comprised two dogs, a boar, a lion, a deer, and a snake, each
throwing a jet into the basin below. The fountain jets, however,
were not in all cases so closely related to the ornamental
pieces. A number of those in the house of the Vettii sprang
from lead pipes near the figures. The familiar bronze statue of
the seated fisherman, in the Naples Museum, belonged to a fountain,
in which the jet was thrown forward, not from the figure,
but from the mouth of a mask projecting from the stump on
which the fisherman sits.</p>

<p>Of the statues of divinities set up for worship in the temples,
there are unfortunately but few remains. The most important
fragment is the head of Jupiter, discussed in a previous chapter
(<a href="#fig022">Fig. 22</a>). Three wretched terra cotta statues of the gods of the
Capitol were found, as we have seen, in the temple of Zeus Milichius;
and mention has been made also of the herms and other
specimens of sculpture in the courts of the temples of Apollo
and Isis, and in the palaestra. More numerous than any other
class of sculptures, however, are the small bronze images of
tutelary divinities preserved in the domestic shrines. These
are of interest rather from the light which they shed on the
practices of domestic worship than from their excellence as
works of art, and it seems unnecessary to add anything here to
what has already been said in regard to them in the chapter
dealing with the arrangements of the Pompeian house. But
occasionally there were large domestic shrines, in which statues
of merit were placed; among these are two worthy of mention.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span></p>

<p>In the corner of a garden belonging to a house in the first
Region (I. ii. 17) is a shrine faced with white marble, in which
was a small marble statue of Aphrodite, partly supported by a
figure commonly identified as Hope, <i>Spes</i>. The carving is in no
way remarkable, but the statue is of interest on account of the
well preserved coloring applied to the eyes, hair, and dress.
The group is now in the Naples Museum.</p>

<p>A more important example, from the aesthetic point of view,
is the statue of Artemis, of one half life size, shown in <a href="#plate11">Plate XI</a>.
It was found in a house near the Amphitheatre which was excavated
in 1760 and covered up again. It is a careful copy,
made in the time of Augustus, of a Greek masterpiece produced
in the period of the Persian Wars. The original was probably
the Artemis Laphria mentioned by Pausanias. This was a work
of Menaechmus and Soedas, two sculptors of Naupactus. Previous
to the battle of Actium it stood in a sanctuary in Calydon,
whence it was removed by Augustus, who presented it to the
colony founded by him at Patras.</p>

<p>The goddess appears in this statue as a huntress, moving forward
with a firm but light step; the bow in the left hand has
disappeared. The copyist was remarkably successful in impressing
upon his work the gracious and pleasing character of
the original; the later archaic Greek art, in spite of its conventions,
is full of human feeling. The copy preserved also the
coloring of the model; but the tinting of the Roman colorist
was probably less delicate than that of the Greek limner who
added the polychrome decoration to the marble original. The
hair was yellow. The pupils of the eyes were brown, the eyelashes
and eyebrows black. The rosettes of the diadem were
yellow, and the border of the outer garment was richly variegated
in tints of yellow, rose color, and white. Traces of rose-colored
stripes are visible also about the openings of the sleeves,
on the edge of the mantle at the neck, and on the border of the
chiton.</p>

<p>Besides the bronze statues of Apollo and Artemis already
mentioned (<a href="#Page_88">pp. 88</a>, <a href="#Page_352">352</a>), four others of those found at Pompeii
are worthy of more than passing notice,&mdash;the dancing satyr
from which the house of the Faun received its name, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
small Silenus used as a standard for a vase, the so-called Narcissus
and the Ephebus found in 1900.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 343px;"><a name="fig258" id="fig258"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 258.&mdash;Dancing Faun. Bronze statuette, now in the
Naples Museum.</p>
</div>

<p>The dancing satyr is shown in <a href="#fig258">Fig. 258</a>. It was found lying
on the floor of the atrium in the house of the Faun, but the
pedestal could not be
identified. The figure
is instinct with
rhythmic motion.
Every muscle of the
satyr's sinewy frame
is in tension as he
moves forward in the
dance, snapping his
fingers to keep time;
the pose is a marvel
of skill. The unhuman
character of the
half-brute is indicated
by the horns projecting
from the forehead,
and the pointed ears.
The face, marked by
low cunning, offers no
suggestion of lofty
thought or moral
sense. We have here
the personification of
unalloyed physical enjoyment.
The satyr,
unvexed by any care
or qualm of conscience,
is intoxicated with the joy of free movement, and dances
on and on, unwearied, with perfect ease and grace.</p>

<p>Muscular tension is skilfully indicated in the Silenus, who
stands holding above his head with his left hand a round frame,
in which, as shown by the fragments, a vase of colored glass was
standing at the time of the eruption. The head, crowned with
ivy, leans forward and to the right, and the right hand is moved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
away from the body in the effort to balance the weight supported
by the left. The frame is awkwardly designed to represent
a snake. The thick-set figure of Silenus is about sixteen
inches high. This bronze was discovered in 1864, in the house
of Popidius Priscus (VII. ii. 20).</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 259.&mdash;Listening Dionysus, wrongly identified as Narcissus. Bronze statuette in the

</div>

<p>The third of the bronzes mentioned is also a statuette, about
two feet high (<a href="#fig259">Fig. 259</a>). It was found in 1863 in a house of the
seventh Region (VII. xii. 21). The figure is that of a youth of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
remarkable beauty. The face wears an expression of childlike
innocence and pleasure. The head leans forward in the attitude
of listening; the index finger of the right hand is extended, and
the graceful pose is that of one who catches the almost inaudible
sound of a distant voice.</p>

<p>The name Narcissus, given to the figure by Fiorelli immediately
upon its discovery, is surely wrong; that unhappy youth
did not reciprocate the love of the nymph Echo, and could not
have been imagined with so cheerful a face. The figure has
also been called Pan, from a myth in which Pan and Echo
appear together; but the characteristic attributes are lacking,
and the rough god of the shepherds would not have been represented
in so lithe and graceful a form.</p>

<p>This beautiful youth, with an ivy crown upon his head and
elaborate coverings for the feet, and with the skin of a doe
hanging over his shoulder, is none other than Dionysus himself.
The mirthful god of the vine is not playing with his panther&mdash;the
base is too small to have been designed for two figures, and
the attitude of listening is not consistent with this interpretation.
The youthful divinity has fixed his attention upon some distant
sound,&mdash;the cries of the bacchantes upon some mountain height,
or the laughter of naiads in a shady glen.</p>

<p>Of unusual interest is the bronze statue of an ephebus, discovered
in November, 1900, outside the city on the north side,
about a hundred paces from the Vesuvius Gate; it was laid
away in an upper room of a house presenting nothing else
worthy of note. It is apparently a Greek original, and is of
three-quarters life size (<a href="#fig260">Fig. 260</a>).</p>

<p>The statue represents a youth about fourteen years of age, of
slender but well-developed form, and finely chiselled features.
Advancing with firm but graceful step, he rests the right foot,
and is bringing the left foot forward. In his right hand, extended,
he carried some object&mdash;a branch, it may be, or a crown,
which was to be laid upon an altar; the eye naturally follows
the movement of the hand.</p>

<p>Especially effective is the rhythmic movement of the body.
The right thigh, sustained by the resting foot, is carried slightly
forward; the chest on the left side swings back, while in consequence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
of the extension of the right hand the shoulders remain
horizontal. Notwithstanding the felicity of the pose, it must be
confessed that the modelling as a whole is somewhat lacking in
vigor, the treatment of details being superficial.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 260.&mdash;Bronze youth. Naples Museum.</p>
</div>

<p>In Greece, before it was carried off to Italy, the figure may
have been set up as a
votive offering in some
sanctuary, or have
stood in a gymnasium.
From indications on the
under side of the feet
it is clear that the
statue, after the manner
in vogue in Greece,
was mounted on a stone
pedestal, being joined
to the pedestal with
melted lead; the round
bronze base found with
it is of Italian origin.
Probably when it was
being transported from
Greece the eyes, of
marble, became loose
in their sockets and fell
down into the hollow
interior of the statue;
they were replaced by
glass eyes. The breaking
of the right arm,
which was severed
when found, made possible the recovery of the original eyes,
which have now again been set in place.</p>

<p>Insensible to the charm of the figure when seen as the sculptor
designed it, the Pompeian owner, deciding to turn it to practical
use, converted it into a lampholder. In the right hand was
placed a short bar of bronze, to either end of which was fastened
a small ornament with a projecting arm, for a hanging lamp;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
the whole statue was then coated with silver. However barbarous
the taste that prompted the transformation, the decorative
effect of the silvered statue with its lighted lamps must have
been far from unpleasant.</p>

<p>Regarding the place of the statue in relation to the development
of Greek sculpture, it is yet too early to speak.</p>

<p>Had the ruins of Pompeii not been systematically searched,
after the disaster, for works of art and other objects of value,
they would have yielded a far richer store of sculptures. But
while the specimens recovered add little to our knowledge of
types, they give a new insight into the application of the sculptor's
art in antiquity to the beautifying of the surroundings of
everyday life.

<h3>CHAPTER LIV<br />

<span class="s08"><i>PAINTING.&mdash;WALL DECORATION</i></span></h3>

<p>The inner walls of houses and public buildings at Pompeii
were plastered, and usually decorated with colors; only storerooms,
kitchens, and apartments designed for the use of slaves
were left in the white. Outer walls were as a rule plastered,
except when built of hewn stone, a kind of construction not
employed after the Tufa Period. Stucco was occasionally used
on façades of ashlar work where special ornamentation seemed
to be needed, as at the entrance of the house of the Faun; and
in later times, now and then, a front with reticulate or brick
facing was left unplastered. Previous to the time of Augustus
the stucco coating of outer walls ordinarily remained uncolored.
Afterwards color was employed, but only to a limited extent,
as in the addition of a dark base to a wall the rest of which
remained white.</p>

<p>The painting upon Pompeian walls, as shown by the painstaking
investigations of Otto Donner, was fresco, that is, executed
in water colors upon the moist stucco of a freshly plastered
surface. The method of preparing the wall was less elaborate
than that recommended by Vitruvius, who advises the use of
seven coats of plaster, first a rough coat, then three of sand
mortar and three of stucco made with powdered marble, each
coat being finer than the one preceding. In the better rooms,
however, we find upon the walls at least one, often several,
layers of sand mortar, and one or more coats of marble stucco;
the entire thickness of the plastering varies from two to three
inches. In unfinished or neglected rooms walls are sometimes
found with a single coat of sand mortar. Occasionally powdered
brick was used in the stucco as a substitute for marble dust.</p>

<p>Plastering so thick as that ordinarily used must have remained
moist for a considerable length of time, much longer than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
plastering of our day; yet it could not have retained its moisture
long enough to complete the painting of an entire wall as one
piece. Walls which are elaborately decorated sometimes show
traces of a seam, where a moist section was laid on next to one
that had already become partially dry. When the decorative
design included pictures, usually the divisions and borders and
other decorative elements were finished rapidly while the surface
was moist; then a square or round hole was cut where a
picture was to be inserted, and filled with fresh stucco, on which
the picture was painted. In this way a carefully executed
painting could be set in a wall already dry.</p>

<p>In the last years of the city pictures were sometimes painted
on the dry surface of a wall that had previously received its
decorative framework; some of the figures seen in the middle
of the large panels furnish examples of this method of work.
A size of some kind must have been used in such cases, but
chemical analysis thus far has failed to determine its nature.
The distemper painting was much less durable than the fresco,
the colors of which became fixed with the hardening of the
wall.</p>

<p>Sometimes, as in the house of Lucretius, the place of paintings
upon stucco was taken by paintings upon wood, the wooden
panels being let into the wall. As these panels were thin and
lacked durability, we may perhaps believe that the paintings
which they contained were of inferior quality.</p>

<p>The artistic value of Pompeian painting varies from the routine
work of indifferent decorators to pictures of genuine merit,
such as those found in the house of the Tragic Poet, the house
of the Vettii, and the house of Castor and Pollux. Viewed as a
whole, the wall decoration has a peculiar interest for us; it not
only richly illustrates the application of painting by the ancients
to decorative uses, but also affords a striking example of the
evolution of decorative designs from simple architectural motives
to intricate patterns, in which the scheme of coloring is hardly
less complicated than that of the ornamental forms.</p>

<p class="p2">The four styles of wall decoration were briefly characterized
in the Introduction, in connection with our survey of the periods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
of construction. It now remains to illustrate these by typical
examples and to trace their inner connection. We are here
concerned only with the decorative designs, or ornamental
framework of the walls; the paintings, which formed the
centre of interest in the later styles, are reserved for consideration
in a separate chapter.</p>

<p>The development of ancient wall decoration came comparatively
late, after the art of painting, in the hands of the Greek
masters, had reached and passed its climax. Yet we know
almost nothing in regard to the earlier stages. Apparently the
system which we find at Pompeii originated in the period following
the death of Alexander the Great, and received its impulse
of development from the contact of Greece with the Orient.
But whatever the origin, from the time to which the earliest
specimens at Pompeii belong&mdash;the second century <span class="s08">B.C.</span>&mdash;to
the destruction of the city, we can trace an uninterrupted development,
which, nevertheless, comes to an end in the latter
part of the first century <span class="s08">A.D.</span></p>

<p>The decline is characterized by increasing poverty of design,
with feeble imitation of past styles. Just as it is setting in, however,
extant examples become rare. Some specimens of the
wall decoration of later times, as of the period of the Antonines
and the reign of Septimius Severus, are preserved, but they are
isolated and not sufficient in number to enable us to follow the
stages of the decline. Thus it happens that the only period in
the history of ancient wall decoration in regard to which we
have the materials for a full and satisfactory study, is the period
exemplified in the remains at Pompeii, the chronological sequence
of which extends over two centuries.</p>

<p>The oldest houses, those belonging to the Period of the Limestone
Atriums (<a href="#Page_39">p. 39</a>), have preserved no traces of wall decoration
beyond the limited application of white stucco.</p>

<p>The remains of the decoration of the Tufa Period are fairly
abundant, and are well preserved on account of the excellent
quality of the stucco to which the colors were applied. They
belong to the first or Incrustation Style. A good example
has already been given, the end wall of a bedroom in the house
of the Centaur (<a href="#fig122">Fig. 122</a>); we present here, for more detailed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>
examination, the left wall of the atrium in the house of Sallust
(<a href="#fig261">Fig. 261</a>).</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the lack of color in our illustration, the
divisions of the wall are plainly seen&mdash;a dado, painted yellow;
a relatively low middle division, the upper edge of which is set
off by a projecting cornice; and an upper part reaching from
the first cornice, which appears in three sections on account of
the doors, to the second. The surface of the main part of the
wall is moulded in stucco to represent slabs or blocks with bevelled
edges, which are painted in imitation of different kinds of
marble. Above the high double doors opening into rooms connected
with the atrium, frames of lattice-work for the admission
of air and light have been assumed in our restoration.</p>

<p>The dado in the Incrustation Style is generally treated as a
separate member; in rare instances the imitation of marble
blocks is extended to the floor. It has a smooth surface and is
painted a bright color, usually yellow; there is no suggestion
of the practice of later times, which gave a darker color to the
base than to the rest of the wall. This independent handling
is undoubtedly to be explained as a survival from a previous
decorative system, in which the lower part of the wall, as at
Tiryns, was protected by a baseboard; the conventional yellow
color with which it is painted, as in the case of the lower stripe
of the Doric architrave in the house of the Faun (<a href="#Page_51">p. 51</a>), is a
reminiscence of the use of wood. The upper edge of the dado
was ordinarily distinguished by a smooth, narrow projecting
band or fillet.</p>

<p>The blocks moulded in slight relief upon the main part of the
wall are of different sizes. In our illustration we see first a
series of three large slabs, which are painted black. Above
these are three narrow blocks of magenta. The rest present
a considerable variety of size and color, until we reach those
just under the cornice, which again are all of the same shade,
magenta.</p>

<p>The cornice in this style is always of the Ionic type, with
dentils. In many cases, as that of the bedroom in the house
of the Centaur, it serves as an upper border for the decoration,
the wall above being unpainted. Sometimes, however, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
imitation of marble is carried above the cornice, the wall surface
being divided to represent smoothly joined blocks without
bevelled edges, or painted in plain masses of color separated
by a narrow white stripe, as in the atrium of the house of Sallust.
Above these brilliant panels we see in <a href="#fig261">Fig. 261</a> a second
cornice of simple design; the wall between this cornice and the
ceiling was left without decoration.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig261" id="fig261"></a>
<img src="images/fig261.jpg" width="541" height="326" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 261.&mdash;Wall decoration in the atrium of the house of Sallust. First or
Incrustation Style.</p>
</div>

<p>This system made no provision for paintings; their place was
taken in the general scheme of decoration by elaborate mosaic
pictures upon the floor. The taste of the age evidently preferred
representations in mosaic; otherwise the painting of
pictures upon the walls, which was brought to so high a degree
of perfection by Polygnotus and his contemporaries, would not
have been abandoned.</p>

<p>The Incrustation Style, as exemplified at Pompeii, is in a
secondary stage; it must have been worked out originally in
genuine materials, at a time when walls were actually veneered,
to a certain height, with slabs of various kinds of marble, cut
and arranged to represent ashlar work; above the cornice
marking the upper edge of the veneering, the surface was left
in the white. The use of different varieties of marble points
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span>
to an active commercial intercourse between the countries about
the Mediterranean Sea, such as first became possible after the
conquests of Alexander. So characteristic a style, requiring
the use of costly materials, could only have been developed in
an important centre of wealth and culture.</p>

<a href="images/fig262fs.jpg">View larger image</a></p>
</div>

<p>In view of all the circumstances, we are probably safe in
concluding that the Incrustation Style originated in Alexandria,
in the third century <span class="s08">B.C.</span> From Alexandria it spread to other
cities of the East and West, stucco being used in imitation of
marble, where marble could not be procured; scanty remains
similar to those at Pompeii, and of approximately the same
period&mdash;the second century <span class="s08">B.C.</span>&mdash;have been found at Pergamon,
on the island of Delos, and lately in Priene. This style
represents for us the wall decoration of the Hellenistic age. It
is characterized by the same poverty of form and obvious striving
after simplicity which we have noticed in the architecture of
the Tufa Period. The projecting cornice above the body of the
wall is always of the same type; yet the second century B.C.
enjoyed a rich heritage of architectural forms, and lack of variety
in this and other details of ornamentation was due, not to
dearth of materials, but to the prevailing taste.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span></p>

<p>The earliest known example of the decoration of the second
or Architectural Style, is on the walls of the Small Theatre,
which was built soon after 80 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> The style remained in vogue
till the middle of the reign of Augustus; it may be loosely
characterized as the wall decoration of the first century B.C. It
shows an interesting development from simpler to richer and
more complex forms. The more elaborate and finished designs
are not so well exemplified at Pompeii as in Rome, where two
beautiful series have been found, both dating from the earlier
part of the reign of Augustus. One series is in the so-called
house of Livia or Germanicus on the Palatine. The other was
found in a house on the right bank of the Tiber, excavated in
1878; the paintings were removed to the new Museo delle
Terme. The specimen shown in <a href="#plate12">Plate XII</a>, however, is from a
Pompeian wall; the room in which it was found opens off from
the peristyle of a house in the fifth Region (V. i. 18).</p>

<p>The oldest walls of the second style closely resemble those of
the first, with this characteristic difference: the imitation of
marble veneering is no longer produced with the aid of relief;
color alone is employed, upon a plane surface, as in the cella of
the temple of Jupiter (<a href="#fig020">Fig. 20</a>). The earlier division of the
wall into three parts is retained, but the painted cornice, no
longer restricted to the dentil type, appears in a variety of
forms. The base also is treated with greater freedom. Frequently
it is painted in strong projection, as if the rest of the
wall above it were further from the eye, while upon the shelf
thus formed are painted columns reaching to the ceiling and
seemingly in front of the main part of the wall; such columns
and pillars, with Corinthian capitals, are seen in <a href="#plate12">Plate XII</a>, at the
right and the left.</p>

<div class="figcenter p6"><a name="plate12" id="plate12"></a>
<img src="images/plate12.jpg" width="468" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PLATE XII.&mdash;SPECIMEN OF WALL DECORATION. SECOND OR
ARCHITECTURAL STYLE</p>
</div>

<p>Thus the designs of this style at first comprised only simple
elements, a wall made up of painted blocks or panels with a dado
painted in projection supporting columns that seemed to carry
an architrave on which the ceiling rested; there is an excellent
example in the house of the Labyrinth, on the walls of a room
at the rear of the garden. But the designs gradually became
more complex, partly through the differentiation of the simple
elements, partly through the introduction of new motives, until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
a complete architectural system was developed. This system
differs from that of the fourth style, which is also architectural,
in that it adheres in the main to actual or possible structural
forms, while those of the fourth style are fantastic in their proportions
and arrangement.</p>

<p>In this process of development two clearly defined tendencies
become manifest, one affecting the treatment of the upper
division of the wall, the other the elaboration of a characteristic
motive which now first appears, a framework for the principal
painting; for architectural designs are well adapted for the display
of pictures, and wall paintings now begin to have a prominent
place in Pompeian decoration.</p>

<p>The upper division tends more and more to be represented as
an open space, behind the plane of projection in which the main
part appears. Thus in <a href="#plate12">Plate XII</a> we see on either side a silver
vase with fruits and vine leaves, standing on the cornice of the
main wall, in the open. Often the upper space is painted blue,
as if one caught a glimpse of the sky above the wall; sometimes
the outline of a wall further beyond is seen, or columns in the
rear connected with those in front by a decorative framework;
and not infrequently small architectural designs, in perspective,
rest upon the cornice where the vases are shown in our plate.
But in all the designs of this style, complex as well as simple,
the threefold division of the wall carried over from the first
style is retained; very often the distinction between the base,
main wall, and upper portion is emphasized by painting them so
that they seem to be in three planes of projection.</p>

<p>The ornamental framework for the painting, consistently with
the architectural character of the decoration as a whole, is
generally conceived as a pavilion projecting from the wall; so
in <a href="#plate12">Plate XII</a>, where we see two columns sustaining a roof, upon
the front of which winged figures stand, each with a hand
extended upward to the entablature of the large pillars at the
sides. The design of the pavilion is suggested by that of a
shrine, such a shrine as the one in the apse of the sanctuary of
the City Lares (<a href="#fig041">Fig. 41</a>).</p>

<p>This conception is here borne out by the subject of the painting,
which represents a statue of Dionysus resting, ivy-crowned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
with a thyrsus in his left hand; the right hand is thrown gracefully
over the head, and at the feet of the god the lifelike figure
of a panther is seen. The round high pedestal supporting the
group is in the open, and the background affords a charming
vista among the trees.</p>

<p>This framing of the principal painting led further to the
division of the body of the wall vertically into three sections,
a broad central section, included within the outline of the
pavilion, and two panels, one at each side. The arrangement
is well illustrated in our plate, the side panels of which are
adorned with painted statues of tastefully draped figures, one of
them holding a lyre. The later styles of decoration retained
this symmetrical division of the wall space, which made prominent
the picture of greatest interest without detracting from the
finish of the decorative setting; but in the fourth style it is often
obscured by the intricacy of the designs.</p>

<p>The third style came into vogue during the reign of Augustus,
and was prevalent until about 50 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>; we shall call it the
Ornate Style, from its free use of ornament. It was developed
out of the second style in the same way that the second style
was developed out of the first; but the transition was not accomplished
at Pompeii, which, like the provincial cities of our
day, received its fashions from the great centres.</p>

<p>The characteristics of the Ornate Style, as regards both the
main design and the ornamentation, may easily be perceived
from the example presented in <a href="#fig263">Fig. 263</a>, especially if this is
viewed in contrast with the specimen of the preceding style
shown in <a href="#plate12">Plate XII</a>. The architectural design has now lost all
semblance of real construction. Columns, entablatures, and
other members are treated conventionally, as subordinate parts
of a decorative scheme; they are, with few exceptions, reduced
to narrow bands or stripes of color dividing the surface of the
wall. The elaborate border of the central painting suggests
a pavilion, yet the projecting base, which in the second style
gave this design its significance, is lacking. Hardly less noteworthy
is the treatment of the upper portion of the wall. Fanciful
architectural forms and various ornaments stand out against
a white background, suggestive of the open sky; yet in our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
example, as often in this style, there is no organic connection
between the decoration of the main part of the wall and that
of the ceiling.</p>

<p>Every part of the framework of the third style is profusely
ornamented. The ornamental system is seen to have a certain
affinity with that of Egypt, and Egyptian figures occasionally
appear; whence we infer that it was developed in Alexandria.
Early in the reign of Augustus, in consequence of the relations
with Egypt following the battle of Actium, a new impulse may
well have been given to the introduction into Italy of Alexandrian
art.</p>

<p>The specimen of the third style shown in <a href="#fig263">Fig. 263</a> is from the
beautiful decoration of the house of Spurius Mesor, portions
of which are well preserved. The base of our specimen consists
of two parts, a lower border and a broad stripe of black
divided into sections of different shapes and sizes by lines of
light color. In the small sections ornaments are seen painted
in delicate shades, two of them being faces.</p>

<p>The large painting presents a mythological scene, but the
subject is not clear. The priestess seems to be performing a
ceremony of expiation in order to free from the taint of some
crime the young man who, with a wreath on his head and a
sword, pointed downward, in his right hand, bends over the
hind just slain as a sacrifice. The colors are subdued and effective;
the painting from the technical point of view is among
the best found at Pompeii.</p>

<p>Around the painting are narrow black stripes separated by
white lines; in the broader stripe underneath, between the
columns, are two light blue birds upon a dull red ground. The
small squares in the flat cornice above are of many colors,
shades of green, pink, and brown predominating. The broad
panels on either side of the painting are of the color often
called Pompeian red; they have an ornamented border, and a
small winged figure in the centre. The stripe below these
shows vases and other ornaments on an orange-yellow ground;
that above, interrupted by the cornice over the painting, is black,
with various ornaments, as baskets of fruit, sistrums, and geese,
painted in neutral colors. Among the ornaments of the upper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
part of the wall, festoons of leaves, vines, vases, parrots, and
griffins can be distinguished, painted in light shades of brown,
blue, green, and yellow.</p>

</div>

<p>The effect of the Ornate Style, with its symmetrical forms
and variety of detail, is pleasing; but the free use of neutral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
tones gives the walls a somewhat cold and formal appearance
when we bring into contrast the warm coloring of the next
period.</p>

<p>The fourth or Intricate Style first appears about the middle
of the first century <span class="s08">A.D.</span> It started, as did the third, with the
symmetrical division of the wall developed in the second style;
it differs from the third in that it always retained a sense of
architectural form. The columns are often fluted, as in a specimen
in the Naples Museum (<a href="#fig264">Fig. 264</a>). The entablatures and
coffered ceilings, light and airy as they often seem, have nevertheless
a suggestion of reality; we know that architectural forms
are presented, and not mere stripes of color. Yet the difference
between the fourth and the second style is no less apparent.
In the latter the architectural designs are not inconsistent with
real construction; in the former the imagination of the designer
had free scope, producing patterns so fantastic and intricate
that the fundamental idea at the basis of the wall divisions
seems entirely lost sight of at times.</p>

<p>The preference for architectural forms was carried so far that
between the large panels of black, red, or yellow, vertical sections
of wall were left which were filled with airy structures on
a white background; the parts represented as nearest the beholder
were painted yellow, those further back were adorned
with all the colors of the rainbow, thus forming a kind of color
perspective (<a href="#fig265">Fig. 265</a>). The designs of the main part were extended
into the upper division, and frequently the whole wall
appears as an intricate scaffolding, partially concealed by the
large panels; these sometimes have the appearance of tapestries
hanging suspended from the scaffolding, and are so treated, as
in the case of the curtains shown in <a href="#plate13">Plate XIII</a>. The fundamental
conception of the decorative system is lost when the background
of the upper part and of the airy scaffoldings is no
longer left white, but painted the same color as the rest of the
wall, so that the effect of distance and perspective is obscured.
Occasionally, also, the architectural framework of the upper portion
of the wall has no connection with that of the main part.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 264.&mdash;Specimen of wall decoration. Fourth style.</p>
</div>

<p>The ornaments of the fourth style were taken largely from
the domain of plastic art. Groups of statuary as well as single
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
figures appear either upon projecting portions of the architectural
framework, as in <a href="#fig264">Fig. 264</a>, or in the background. They
are frequently painted
yellow, suggesting the
gilding applied to ancient
statues, particularly
those of bronze,
and present a striking
contrast to the masses
of strong color in the
large panels and the
brilliant shades of the
architectural designs.
They are in harmony
with the taste of the
period, which, as we
have seen, manifested
a fondness for ornamentation
in stucco
relief, the effect of
which was heightened
by the free use of color.</p>

<p>The large panels contained
paintings of various
sizes, sometimes
copies of masterpieces,
more often a simple
floating figure or a Cupid;
groups are also
found, as Cupid and
Pysche, or a satyr with
a bacchante. The appearance of a picture worked in tapestry is
given by a border just inside the framework of the panel, as
often in the decoration of the fourth style.</p>

<p>The fourth style cannot have been derived from the third.
It is organically related with the second, out of which it was
developed by laying stress on precisely that element, the architectural,
the suppression of which gave rise to the third style
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>
of decoration. The most reasonable explanation of the relations
of the four styles, briefly stated, is this:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Incrustation Style, a direct offshoot of Hellenistic art, was
prevalent in eastern cities, where it was naturally followed by the
Architectural Style; this may have been developed at one centre
or, in different phases, at different centres contemporaneously.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:545px;"><a name="fig265" id="fig265"></a>
<img src="images/fig265.jpg" width="543" height="491" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 265.&mdash;Specimen of wall decoration. Fourth style.<br />
In the middle panel, mythological scene in which Hercules is the principal figure; in each
of the panels, a satyr and a bacchante.</p>
</div>

<p>At some prominent centre, probably Alexandria, the Architectural
Style passed over into the Ornate Style, which was
introduced into Italy in the reign of Augustus and remained in
vogue till the middle of the first century <span class="s08">A.D.</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, at some other centre of culture, possibly Antioch,
the Architectural Style, by an equally natural course of development,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>
had passed over into the Intricate Style, which was first
brought to Pompeii about 50 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> and remained in fashion till
the destruction of the city.</p>

<p>The earthquake of the year 63 threw down some buildings
and made necessary the thorough-going repair of many others.
Between that year and 79, more walls were freshly decorated,
probably, than in any previous period of equal length in the
history of the city. For this reason, examples of decoration in
the Intricate Style are much more numerous than might have
been expected from the length of time that it was in vogue;
they give the prevailing cast to the remains of painting in the
ruins, and this style is ordinarily thought of when Pompeian
wall decoration is referred to. The complex designs and brilliant
colors form a decorative scheme which is often most effective,
although the system of the third style reveals a finer and
more correct taste.</p>

<p>If no remains of the two earlier styles had survived to modern
times, the antecedents and relations of the other two could not
possibly be understood. But with the first two in mind, we are
able to see clearly how the most complex forms of the later
decoration may be reduced, in last analysis, to simple elements.
Even in the example of the Intricate Style given in <a href="#plate13">Plate XIII</a>,
we find a suggestion of the threefold division of the wall into
base, main part, and upper part, which was so prominent in the
Incrustation Style; and also an elaborate structural form at the
middle of the wall recalling the pavilion framework of the second
style, with a symmetrical arrangement of the architectural
designs on either side, suggesting the panels at the sides of the
principal painting.</p>

<p>The slabs of colored marble in the Incrustation Style are represented
by panels for pictures or ornamental forms of all shapes
and sizes; and the architectural designs, so simple at the beginning,
have by almost imperceptible changes and additions become
decorative patterns so varied and intricate that taken by
themselves they give no hint of their origin.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LV<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE PAINTINGS</i></span></h3>

<p>The hanging of pictures upon the walls seems not to have
been in vogue at Pompeii during the period to which the remains
belong. The system of decoration left no room for
framed paintings, and no traces of any such have been discovered.
The paintings which have been preserved at Pompeii,
not merely the small groups and single figures introduced
to enliven the design, but the large compositions as well, all
formed a part of the wall decoration.</p>

<p>The number is relatively large. In the catalogue by Helbig,
published in 1868, there are nearly two thousand entries, including
a few paintings from Herculaneum and other Campanian
sites. The supplement compiled by Sogliano in 1879
records more than eight hundred pictures brought to light in
the preceding decade. We are probably safe in estimating the
whole number of Pompeian paintings still in existence, or known
from description, as about thirty-five hundred.</p>

<p>In all this wealth of examples, however, it is not possible to
find any evidence of a progressive development either in composition
or in technique. There are indeed slight differences,
mainly in regard to technical handling and color scheme, which
distinguish the paintings found in the decoration of the third
style from those of the other two styles in which paintings
appear; but, on the other hand, the distinction between those of
the second and those of the fourth style is much less marked.</p>

<p>The period from 80 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> to 79 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> was as little creative in the
field of painting as in that of sculpture. No new types appear,
no improvements are worked out; the painter, as the sculptor,
was an eclectic, who drew upon the creations of the past as suited
his fancy, and contented himself with copying or imitating. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
the adaptation of paintings to decorative use the artist reproduced
either entire compositions or single motives which seemed to
answer his purpose. The general preference was for paintings
of the Hellenistic age, after the death of Alexander; yet
examples of earlier styles are occasionally found, as the Sacrifice
of Iphigenia (<a href="#fig156">Fig. 156</a>) and the dramatic scene in which Orestes
and Pylades appear before King Thoas (<a href="#fig182">Fig. 182</a>).</p>

<p>New discoveries and the progress of research will sometime,
perhaps, make it possible to present a general survey of the
Pompeian paintings from the historical and critical point of
view. No such comprehensive treatment is yet possible, however,
and we must content ourselves with offering a few observations
in regard to the distribution of the paintings among the
different decorative styles and the classes of subjects represented.</p>

<p>The Incrustation Style, as previously remarked, left no place
for paintings upon the walls. Nevertheless, in isolated cases,
we find a simple pictorial representation upon the surface of
one of the blocks painted in imitation of marble, as if the veins
of the stone had run into a shape suggestive of an object, as a
vase or a bird; in one instance, curiously enough, a wrestling
match is outlined, between Hercules and Antaeus. In the Tufa
Period the desire for paintings was satisfied by the mosaic
pictures upon the floor.</p>

<p>The earlier walls of the second style in this respect resemble
those of the first; the examples in the house of the Labyrinth
have no paintings. The later walls, however, are rich in
pictures, but those of Pompeii are not so abundantly adorned as
those in Rome (<a href="#Page_462">p. 462</a>). The elaborate painting shown in the
pavilion frame in <a href="#plate12">Plate XII</a> is exceptional among the Pompeian
remains of this style.</p>

<p>The great majority of the paintings are found upon walls of
the third and fourth styles. On the older walls of the third
style, as we have seen, the principal painting appears in a frame,
the design of which is taken from that of the conventional
pavilion of the second style. In later examples the close
relation between the picture and the frame is no longer maintained;
the frame simply encloses a large panel of uniform
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span>
color, in the middle of which a relatively small picture is seen.
This arrangement was carried over into the fourth style, but the
conception of a pavilion frame is entirely lost sight of; the
painting is in the middle of a large panel of brilliant color,
around which the architectural framework is extended. A
Pompeian room well decorated in either of the later styles contained
four of these prominent paintings, in case there was no
door at the middle of one of the sides; if a door interfered,
there were only three.</p>

<p>Paintings were also placed in the divisions of the wall at the
right and the left of the central panel. In <a href="#plate12">Plate XII</a> we noticed
a single figure on either side of the pavilion, but such additions
are rare in the second style. In the third style the side panels
are uniformly adorned with paintings. In <a href="#fig263">Fig. 263</a> the small
figure in the middle of the panel at the left is a Cupid; frequently
a flying swan is seen, or a landscape lightly sketched in monochrome
on the ground of the panel. Sometimes the painting is
set off by a separate frame; if this is round, a bust is usually
represented. Groups of two figures were preferred for the side
panels of the fourth style, the favorite subject being a satyr and
a bacchante, as in <a href="#fig265">Fig. 265</a>; these sometimes appear as busts,
but are more often represented as floating figures.</p>

<p>Characteristic of the fourth style, in respect to the distribution
of paintings, is the use of single figures and simple compositions
to add life to the fantastic architectural designs in the
upper part of the wall and in the divisions between the large
panels. Here we may see satyrs and bacchantes, young girls
and solemn-visaged men with implements of sacrifice; the
figures appear in great variety of type and subject. Sometimes
groups are broken up, and the elements of a mythological
scene, as that of Admetus and Alcestis, are distributed as single
figures in the architectural framework.</p>

<p>At the time of the eruption the fondness for pictorial representations
was increasing, and they were being introduced into
every part of the decoration, including the frieze of the main
part of the wall, the use of which in this way commenced in
the time of the third style (<a href="#fig263">Fig. 263</a>), and the stripe below,
between the main part of the wall and the base (<a href="#fig265">Fig. 265</a>);
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>
how elaborate this intermediate decoration might become we
have already seen in the case of the house of the Vettii.</p>

<p>Frequently in the fourth style the lower part of the architectural
framework separating two large panels appears to be
closed, as in <a href="#plate13">Plate XIII</a>, by a narrow panel, above which a
painting is seen. The pictures found in these places often
represent still life. Seafights are also a favorite subject; such
may be seen in the temple of Isis, the Macellum, and one of the
rooms in the house of the Vettii. Generally on the walls of
the fourth style, wherever there is available space, we find small
pictures in great variety, the most common being landscapes,
simply painted, with the use of few colors.</p>

<p>It is by no means easy to make a satisfactory classification of
Pompeian paintings according to subject. Nevertheless, with a
few exceptions, they may be roughly grouped in four general
classes, mythological paintings, genre paintings, landscapes, and
still life. Most of the large and important pictures belong to
the first class. The mythological paintings will therefore be
discussed at somewhat
greater length; the
other three classes will
require only a brief
characterization.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 336px;"><a name="fig266" id="fig266"></a>
<img src="images/fig266.jpg" width="336" height="222" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 266.&mdash;A fruit piece, Xenion.</p>
</div>

<p>The still-life paintings
represent all kinds
of meat, fish, fowl, and
fruits. According to
Vitruvius, this kind of
picture was called Xenion.
The reason given
for the name recalls a curious custom of ancient Greece. When
a guest, <i>xenos</i>, was received into a Greek home, says this writer,
he was invited to sit at the table for one day. After that provisions
were furnished to him uncooked, and he prepared his
own meals. A portion of unprepared victuals thus came to be
called <i>xenion</i>, 'the stranger's portion,' and the name was afterwards
transferred to pictures in which such provisions appear.
A fruit piece, now in the Naples Museum, is shown in <a href="#fig266">Fig. 266</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span></p>

<p>Landscapes are numerous and of all sizes. Occasionally a
garden wall of the fourth style is covered with a single large
painting, in which villas, gardens, roads, and harbors are realistically
presented. Such pictures are of Italian origin; the
name of the artist who first painted them is probably Sextus
Tadius, but the reading of the passage in which the name
occurs (Plin. N. H. XXXV. x. 116) is uncertain.</p>

<p>Common to the third and fourth styles are garden scenes, in
which, behind a light barrier, the plants of a garden appear,
with birds, statues, and fountains. The finest extant example is
in the villa of Livia, at Prima Porta, near Rome.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig267" id="fig267"></a>
<img src="images/fig267.jpg" width="540" height="235" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 267.&mdash;A landscape painting.</p>
</div>

<p>Large landscapes sometimes have a place in the principal
panels of the walls. These are all of Hellenistic origin, and
are found almost without exception in the decoration of the
third style. They generally represent a quiet nook of woodland,
with high cliffs; in the foreground is a shrine&mdash;perhaps
more than one&mdash;with figures of men sacrificing or coming to
offer worship.</p>

<p>The great majority of the landscapes, however, are introduced
into various parts of the decoration outside of the large panels,
and are quite small. In them we see little shrines or villas by
the seaside; a river with a bridge on which a traveller appears
crossing the stream; or buildings on an island or peninsula in
the edge of a body of water, as in <a href="#fig267">Fig. 267</a>. Often they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>
simply light sketches; now and then one of these small landscapes
is painted in a peculiar tint, as if the scene were represented
by moonlight.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig268" id="fig268"></a>
<img src="images/fig268.jpg" width="540" height="514" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 268.&mdash;Group of women, one of whom is sounding two stringed instruments.</p>
</div>

<p>The genre paintings are of special importance on account of
the light they shed on the life and customs of the ancients. A
number have already been described or illustrated in the chapter
on the house of the Vettii, and in the part devoted to the trades
and occupations. To these we should add the picture of an
artist in the house of the Surgeon (<a href="#fig133">Fig. 133</a>), and the scenes
from the life of the Forum (<a href="#fig016">Figs. 16</a>, <a href="#fig017">17</a>).</p>

<p>Here belong also the groups in which figures are seen with
a roll of papyrus or a writing tablet, suggestive of literary pursuits,
and figures with musical instruments. A group of musicians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span>
is shown in <a href="#fig268">Fig. 268</a>, in which are four women, one of
whom is tuning a couple of stringed instruments to sound in
unison.</p>

<p>In the same class are included two small painted busts not
infrequently met with, that of a girl with a writing tablet in her
left hand holding the end of a stylus against her lips, as if
pondering what to write, and that of a young man with one end
of a roll of papyrus, in which he has been reading, under his
chin. A Pompeian baker, Publius Paquius Proculus, brought
these two ideal busts into one painting, substituting for the
faces of the youth and maiden those of himself and his wife
(<a href="#fig269">Fig. 269</a>). The portraits are realistic, but the faces are not
unattractive; that of Proculus seems more kindly and ingenuous
than the face of Caecilius Jucundus (<a href="#fig256">Fig. 256</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig269" id="fig269"></a>
<img src="images/fig269.jpg" width="409" height="449" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 269.&mdash;Paquius Proculus and his wife.</p>
</div>

<p>Two ideal painted busts have recently been found, each of a
youth with a roll of papyrus. Their chief interest lies in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span>
fact that each roll is provided with a narrow tag or label, of the
sort that the Romans called <i>index</i>, on which the names <i>Plato</i>
and <i>Homerus</i> can be plainly read. The two types of face well
correspond with the trend of taste suggested by the titles: the
delicate features and upturned gaze of the one indicate a poetic
temperament; the other has a high forehead and an air of
meditation, appropriate for a student of philosophy.</p>

<p>The mythological paintings rarely present rapid movement.
To the few exceptions belong the two familiar pictures placed
opposite each other in the tablinum of the house of Castor
and Pollux, Achilles among the daughters of Lycomedes on
the island of Scyros, and the quarrel between Achilles and
Agamemnon. Only part of the latter painting is preserved,
but both are strong compositions, and are repeated on other
walls.</p>

<p>Scenes of combat, the interest of which lies in the display of
physical force, are still more infrequently met with, and seem
out of harmony with the prevailing taste. Two pictures from
Herculaneum represent Hercules putting forth his strength; in
one he is struggling with the Nemean lion, in the other carrying
the Erymanthian boar. The few paintings of this kind at
Pompeii are badly preserved. In two of them Meleager appears,
engaged in combat with the boar; in another we see
Achilles before the walls of Troy with drawn sword in one
hand, with the other grasping by the hair Troilus, an effeminate
Trojan youth, attired in Oriental fashion, who mounted
on his horse is vainly trying to escape; a fourth represents
a combat between a heavy-armed warrior and an Amazon.
But such paintings are the more conspicuous by reason of their
rarity, and those that have thus far been discovered are all
found upon walls of the third style.</p>

<p>A much larger number of mythological compositions represent
a moment of dramatic interest, the artist relying for his
effect upon the bearing and facial expression of the persons
appearing in the scene. The interest is purely psychological,
and several of the pictures that have been preserved give us an
exceedingly favorable idea of the ability of ancient painters to
express emotion, especially when we remember that these paintings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span>
are merely decorative copies of masterpieces the originals
of which in most cases had probably never been seen by the
workmen who painted the copies on the walls.</p>

<p>Among the more familiar examples is the face of Orestes in
the painting found in the house of the Citharist (<a href="#fig182">Fig. 182</a>), and
that of Io, watched by Argus, in the Macellum. Emotion is
expressed with even greater skill in the face of Io in a painting
of the temple of Isis. The goddess welcomes the wanderer to
Egypt after her long season of suffering; the traces of the suffering
are clearly seen, yet are illumined by the ineffable and
serene joy of final deliverance.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful specimens of ancient painting is
a fragment, badly preserved, in the tablinum of the house of
Caecilius Jucundus. The
composition probably represented
Priam turning
back toward Troy with
the body of Hector, which
he had just ransomed. In
the fragment, shown in
<a href="#fig270">Fig. 270</a>, we see the aged
Hecuba, together with a
daughter or maidservant,
looking with unutterable
anguish from an upper
window down upon the
scene. The gray-haired
queen, whose features still retain much of their youthful beauty,
gazes upon the dust-stained body of her son with grief too deep
for tears.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 306px;"><a name="fig270" id="fig270"></a>
<img src="images/fig270.jpg" width="306" height="224" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 270.&mdash;Hecuba with a younger companion
looking from an upper window as Priam brings
back the body of Hector.</p>
</div>

<p>In the majority of paintings the subjects of which are taken
from myths the characters are represented either in a relation of
rest, not suggestive of intense emotion, or in a lasting situation
of dramatic interest, which is devoid of momentary excitement
and does not suggest the display of evanescent feeling. The
situation is sometimes cheerful, sometimes calculated to arouse
sympathy; if the characters were not mythological, the scenes
might pass for those of everyday life. Thus we see Narcissus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>
looking at the reflection of his face in a clear spring in the forest;
Polyphemus, on the seashore, receiving from the hands of
a Cupid a letter sent by Galatea; and Apollo playing on the lyre
for Admetus, while the herd grazes around him.</p>

<p>To the same series of cheerful or idyllic pictures belong the
Selene hovering over the sleeping Endymion; Paris and Oenone
on Mt. Ida, Paris cutting the name of his sweetheart in the bark
of a tree; and Perseus with Andromeda looking at the reflection
of the head of Medusa in a pool. With these we may class
also the representations of Bacchus as he moves along with his
rollicking band and suddenly comes upon the sleeping Ariadne;
and Hercules with Omphale, sometimes sitting in woman's attire
beside her and spinning, sometimes staggering in his cups or
lying drunk upon the ground while she stands or sits near him.</p>

<p>Examples of a pathetic situation are equally abundant. We
find Aphrodite caring for the wounded Adonis, and Cyparissus
grieving over the dead stag. The pathos of the scene, however,
is not always so obviously suggested. The familiar painting of
Europa represents the maiden playfully sitting upon the bull,
which one of her girlish companions is caressing. The situation,
from one point of view, is idyllic, yet it brings to mind the
unhappy fate of the girl, borne far away from home over the
sea to a distant land, and the effect is heightened by giving
her a wonderfully beautiful form.</p>

<p>Not infrequently a similar result is produced by placing figures
of incongruous type in sharp contrast; so in the oft-repeated
composition in which the beautiful Thetis in elegant attire sits
in the workshop of Hephaestus, looking at the shield which the
rough and grimy smith is finishing for Achilles. In another
composition Pasiphaë is seen in the shop of Daedalus, who
points out the wooden cow; and a similar idea of contrast must
have been present in the mind of the artist who painted Danaë
after she had been cast ashore in a chest on the island of Seriphus,
sitting on the beach with little Perseus in her lap, while
two fishermen standing near make inquiry concerning her strange
fate.</p>

<p>The symmetrical arrangement of the paintings in a Pompeian
room can hardly have failed to influence the choice of compositions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">481</a></span>
for the principal panels, especially in cases in which
mythological scenes were to be represented. Sometimes, though
not so frequently as might have been expected, pictures were
grouped according to subject. We have already noticed the
relation of two paintings, in the house of Castor and Pollux,
in which Achilles is the principal figure. The first of these,
Achilles among the daughters of Lycomedes, is found in a room
of another house in a group of three; one of the companion
pieces represents Thetis in the smithy of Hephaestus looking
at the weapons which are being made for Achilles, while in the
other she is seen riding over the sea on a Triton, bringing them
to her son. There is another group of three pictures related by
subject in a room in the house of the Vettii; they belong to the
Theban cycle, and represent the infant Hercules strangling the
serpents, the death of Pentheus, and the binding of Dirce.</p>

<p>Similarity of scene and of treatment influenced the selection
of paintings for a room much more often than unity of subject.
A good illustration is the pair of pictures several times found
together, one of which represents Polyphemus on the beach
receiving from a Cupid a letter written by Galatea; in the other
Aphrodite is seen on the seashore fishing, with Cupids all about
her. The suggestion of Love is common to both paintings, but
the juxtaposition of the two as counterparts is due to the similarity
of scene. Opposite the picture of Europa referred to
above, is a Pan playing on his pipe, with nymphs around him;
the two pictures, which appear in a room of the third style, from
the decorative point of view form an effective pair.</p>

<p>A sleeping room of the same style&mdash;though in respect to
grouping no difference between the styles is apparent&mdash;offers
an interesting example of a double group. The four principal
paintings form two pairs. In one pair we see, on one side,
Hercules in the garden of the Hesperides approaching an altar
around which three maidens are standing; on the other, a shrine
of Artemis in a forest with three worshippers drawing near, one
of whom brings a garland. The two pictures harmonize in the
character of the scenery and in the arrangement of the figures.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of the other pair as a decorative counterpart
can be seen in our illustrations; the subject of one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span>
paintings is the fate of the pipes which Athena cast aside
(<a href="#fig271">Fig. 271</a>), and of the other the fall of Icarus (<a href="#fig272">Fig. 272</a>).</p>

<p>In the first of the two pictures we have one of the few extant
examples of a kind of painting associated with the name of
Philostratus, in
which different
scenes representing
the successive stages
of an action are
united in one composition.</p>

<p>In the foreground
at the left sits
Athena, with her
shield on the ground
beside her, playing
the double pipe; a
nymph in front rising
from the surface
of a stream holds up
a mirror in which the
goddess may see her
face reflected as she
plays.</p>

<p>The next two
scenes lie just across
the brook. At the
foot of the cliff sits
the divinity of the
country, Phrygia, in
which the story of
Marsyas is localized.
Above, at the left, we see the satyr with a shepherd's crook in
his left hand blowing a Pan's pipe; he has not yet espied the
pipes thrown away by Athena.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 356px;"><a name="fig271" id="fig271"></a>
<img src="images/fig271.jpg" width="356" height="589" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 271.&mdash;Athena's pipes and the fate of Marsyas.</p>
</div>

<p>At the right he appears again, near the tree, having found
the pipes discarded by the goddess and picked them up. Lastly,
in the middle of the background, we see him playing the pipes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span>
in the presence of the Muses, who are serving as judges in
the contest of skill between the satyr and Apollo.</p>

<p>The final scene with the flaying of Marsyas, which was
sometimes represented in sculpture, and appears also in several
Pompeian paintings,
is here omitted.</p>

<p>The inner connection
of the other picture
is not so clear.
It is perhaps a confused
form of a
composition in
which Icarus, lying
on the ground after
his fall, was the central
figure; the local
divinities and natives
of the region
were looking upon
the body of the hapless
youth with pity;
while Daedalus,
hovering in the air
above, was trying to
find the spot where
he had fallen.</p>

<p>Our artist, however,
thinking to
heighten the effect,
represented Icarus
as plunging headlong
through the air,
with the result shown in the illustration; neither Daedalus nor
the figures in the foreground seem yet to have become aware of
the catastrophe.</p>

<p>We can in no way more appropriately bring to a close our
brief survey of the Pompeian paintings than by presenting a
reproduction of the scene in which Zeus and Hera appear on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span>
Mt. Ida (<a href="#fig273">Fig. 273</a>). This painting has been sufficiently discussed
in another connection (<a href="#Page_316">pp. 316</a>-<a href="#Page_317">317</a>); though preserved
in a damaged condition, it clearly represents an original of no
slight merit.</p>

<h2>PART VI<br />

THE INSCRIPTIONS OF POMPEII</h2>

<h3 class="chap1">CHAPTER LVI<br />

<span class="s08"><i>IMPORTANCE OF THE INSCRIPTIONS.&mdash;MONUMENTAL
INSCRIPTIONS AND PUBLIC NOTICES</i></span></h3>

<p>The inscriptions discovered at Pompeii number more than
six thousand. They cover a wide field, ranging from commemorative
tablets put up at public expense to the scribblings
of idlers upon the plastered walls. It would be an exaggeration
to say that they contribute to our knowledge of antiquity much
that is new; their value lies rather in the insight which they
give into the life of the city and its people.</p>

<p>In one respect the evidence derived from inscriptions, though
often of the most fragmentary character, is especially satisfactory.
We feel that we are handling original documents, without
the intervention of that succession of copyists which stands
between the author of a Greek or Roman masterpiece and the
modern reader. The shapes of the letters and the spelling are
just as they were left by the stonecutter or the scribbler; the
various handwritings can still be as plainly distinguished on the
charred tablets of Caecilius Jucundus as though the signatures
were witnessed only yesterday. Through the inscriptions we
are brought into contact with the personality of the Pompeians
as in no other way.</p>

<p>The inscriptions may be classified either according to the
subject matter or according to the form in which they appear,
whether cut in stone, or painted, or scratched upon a smooth
surface with a stylus. No detailed classification need be given
here; it will be sufficient for our purposes to discuss the main
divisions briefly under four heads,&mdash;monumental inscriptions and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>
public notices, graffiti, and inscriptions relating to business
affairs.</p>

<p class="p2">Monumental inscriptions include those which are cut in hard
material and are intended to be read by all who see them.
They are found at Pompeii chiefly in or upon public buildings,
on pedestals of statues and on sepulchral monuments. They
are characterized by extreme brevity. A few are in the Oscan
language, the rest are in Latin. The more important examples
have been presented in the preceding pages in connection with
the monuments to which they belong. A list of them is given
in the Index under "Inscriptions."</p>

<p>The public notices are painted upon the walls along the sides
of the streets, ordinarily in a bright red color; a few are in
black. The most important are the election notices, in which
a candidate is recommended for a public office. These are
about sixteen hundred in number, and the names of more than
a hundred different candidates appear in them.</p>

<p>The election notices fall into two classes, distinguished both
by the style of writing and by the manner of expression,&mdash;earlier,
from the time of the Republic, and later, belonging to
the Imperial period. The shapes of the letters in those of the
former class are irregular, and bear the mark of an unpractised
hand. The later notices, on the contrary, have a more finished
appearance; they are executed in a kind of calligraphic style
that suggests the employment of skilled clerks who made the
painting of electoral recommendations a part of their business.
We have already met with the name of one painter of notices
who signed his work, Aemilius Celer (<a href="#Page_223">p. 223</a>). His house has
been discovered, near the northeast corner of the ninth Region;
it was identified by means of an inscription painted on the outside:
<i>Aemilius Celer hic habitat</i>,&mdash;'Aemilius Celer lives here.'</p>

<p>The language of the earlier recommendations is of the simplest.
We find the name of the candidate with no suggestion
of praise excepting occasionally the letters <i>v. b.</i>, for <i>virum
bonum</i>, 'good man.' The name of the office is given in an
abbreviated form, but that of the person who makes the recommendation
nowhere appears. In one example the elements of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>
the common formula <i>o. v. f.</i>, for <i>oro vos, facite</i>, are given almost
in full: <i>M. Marium aed. faci., oro vos</i>,&mdash;'Make Marcus Marius
aedile, I beg of you.' The following notice appears on Stabian
Street in letters nearly 8 inches high:
<span class="b12">P · FVR · II · V · \B · O · \F</span>,
that is <i>Publium Furium duumvirum, virum bonum, oro vos,
facite</i>,&mdash;'Make Publius Furius duumvir, I beg of you; he's a
good man.'</p>

<p>Some of the later election notices are almost equally brief,
presenting merely the name of the candidate, the office for
which he is recommended, and the formula <i>o. v. f.</i>, as in this
instance: <i>Herennium Celsum aed[ilem] o. v. f.</i>,&mdash;'Make Herennius
Celsus aedile, I beg of you.' Occasionally even the formula
is omitted, and we have simply the name of the candidate and
of the office, both invariably in the accusative case, as <i>Casellium
aed.</i>, which appears in several places, and <i>M. Holconium Priscum
II. vir. i. d.</i></p>

<p>More frequently the recommendation includes a reference to
the good qualities of the candidate. Sometimes he is simply
styled 'a good man,' as in the earlier notices; but the most
common formula in this connection is <i>d. r. p.</i>, for <i>dignum re
publica</i>, 'worthy of public office.' In some instances the characterization
is more definite. More than one candidate is
affirmed to be 'an upright young man' (<i>iuvenem probum</i>), or
'a youth of singular modesty' (<i>verecundissimum iuvenem</i>). In
regard to one aspirant for office we are informed that 'he will
be the watch-dog of the treasury'&mdash;<i>hic aerarium conservabit</i>.</p>

<p>The names of those who make the recommendations often
appear in the later notices. Now and then individuals assume
the responsibility, as Vesonius Primus (<a href="#Page_396">p. 396</a>), and Acceptus
and Euhodia (<a href="#Page_341">p. 341</a>), who were undoubtedly owners of the
property on which the notices appear. Thus the candidate's
neighbors are sometimes represented as favoring his election, as
in the case of Claudius Verus: <i>Ti. Claudium Verum II. vir.
vicini rogant</i>,&mdash;'His neighbors request the election of Tiberius
Claudius Verus as duumvir.' Electoral recommendations are
painted on all sides of the house of Verus&mdash;the extensive establishment
in the ninth Region known as the house of the Centenary.</p>

<p>The class of election notices in which we find the members of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span>
a craft united in the support of a candidate has been sufficiently
illustrated in another connection (<a href="#Page_384">p. 384</a>). To these we may
add a recommendation found on a wall facing the temple of
Isis: <i>Cn. Helvium Sabinum aed. Isiaci universi rog[ant]</i>,&mdash;'The
worshippers of Isis, as a body, request the election of Gnaeus
Helvius Sabinus as aedile.' A suburb also might have a candidate,
as in the following instance: <i>M. Epidium Sabinum aed.
Campanienses rog.</i>,&mdash;'The inhabitants of the Pagus Campanus
ask for the election of Marcus Epidius Sabinus as aedile.'</p>

<p>Sometimes all those who are engaged in an occupation are
urged to support a candidate. 'Innkeepers, make Sallustius
Capito aedile,' we read in one notice. In others, various classes
of citizens having a common bond, as the ballplayers, and the
dealers in perfumes, are exhorted to work for the election of a
candidate presumably favorable to their interests. In one instance
there is a direct appeal to an individual, involving a
pledge of future support: <i>Sabinum aed[ilem], Procule, fac, et
ille te faciet</i>,&mdash;'Proculus, make Sabinus aedile, and he will do
as much for you.'</p>

<p>In view of the deep interest in the municipal elections, revealed
by these notices, it is not surprising to find that the
support of a candidate by a man of unusual prominence was
extensively advertised. In three different parts of the city the
attention of voters was directed to the fact that Suedius Clemens,
the commissioner sent by Vespasian to decide the ownership of
certain plots of ground (<a href="#Page_407">p. 407</a>), favored the election of Epidius
Sabinus as duumvir. One of the notices reads: <i>M. Epidium
Sabinum II. vir. iur. dic. o. v. f., dignum iuvenem, Suedius
Clemens sanctissimus iudex facit vicinis rogantibus</i>,&mdash;'At the
request of the neighbors, Suedius Clemens, most upright judge, is
working for the election of Marcus Epidius Sabinus, a worthy
young man, as duumvir with judiciary authority. He begs of
you to elect this candidate.'</p>

<p>So public a method of pressing a candidacy put a formidable
weapon into the hands of the candidate's enemies, and the form
of a recommendation was sometimes used against an office
seeker with telling effect. <i>Vatiam aed. furunculi rog.</i>,&mdash;'The
sneak thieves request the election of Vatia as aedile,' we find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>
conspicuously painted on a wall on Augustales Street. According
to other notices near by, 'The whole company of late
drinkers' (<i>seribibi universi</i>) and 'all the people who are asleep'
(<i>dormientes universi</i>) favored the candidacy of the same unhappy
Vatia. The last notice which we shall present in this
connection may have been painted on the order of the girl who
appears in it: <i>Claudium II. vir. animula facit</i>,&mdash;'His little
sweetheart is working for the election of Claudius as duumvir.'
The reference is probably to the Tiberius Claudius Verus mentioned
above.</p>

<p>The other kinds of public notices are represented by relatively
few examples. Of special interest are the announcements
of gladiatorial combats, which were discussed in a previous
chapter (<a href="#Page_221">p. 221</a>). Next in importance are perhaps the advertisements
of buildings to rent. One of these, relating to the Elephant
Inn, has already been mentioned (<a href="#Page_400">p. 400</a>). We present
here two others, which have to do with large properties. The
first, which has now disappeared, was painted on a wall in the
sixth Region, at the south end of the third Insula. It reads as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
INSULA ARRIANA<br />
POLLIANA CN. ALLEI NIGIDI MAI<br />
LOCANTUR EX K[alendis] IULIS PRIMIS TABERNAE<br />
CUM PERGULIS SUIS ET CENACULA<br />
EQUESTRIA ET DOMUS. CONDUCTOR<br />
CONVENITO PRIMUM, CN. ALLEI<br />
NIGIDI MAI SER[vum].</p>

<p>'To rent, from the first day of next July, shops with the floors
over them, fine upper chambers, and a house, in the Arrius
Pollio block owned by Gnaeus Alleius Nigidius Maius. Prospective
lessees may apply to Primus, slave of Gnaeus Alleius
Nigidius Maius.'</p>

<p>The word <i>equestria</i>, translated 'fine,' is used colloquially with
<i>cenacula</i>, in the sense 'fit for a knight.' The Insula named
after Arrius Pollio was thought by Fiorelli to be the so-called
house of Pansa, across the street from the block on which the
advertisement was found. The identification may be correct,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span>
but a notice painted in so prominent a place might refer to a
block in any part of the city.</p>

<p>The following inscription was found in the last century near
the Amphitheatre, on a wall of the extensive establishment
named from it the villa of Julia Felix:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
IN PRAEDIS IULIAE SP. F. FELICIS<br />
LOCANTUR<br />
BALNEUM VENERIUM ET NONGENTUM, TABERNAE, PERGULAE,<br />
CENÁCULA EX IDIBUS AUG. PRIMIS IN IDUS AUG. SEXTÁS, ANNÓS<br />
CONTINUOS QUINQUE
S. Q. D. L. E. N. C.</p>

<p>'To let, for the space of five years, from the thirteenth day of
next August to the thirteenth day of the sixth August thereafter,
the Venus bath, fitted up for the best people, shops, rooms
over shops, and second story apartments in the property owned
by Julia Felix, daughter of Spurius.'</p>

<p>The bath may have received its name from Venus Pompeiana.
The word <i>nongentum</i> is difficult to understand. The interpretation
given is based upon a passage of Pliny the Elder, from
which we understand that in colloquial language the knights
were known as 'the nine hundred.' A bath 'of the nine hundred'
would then be one designed to attract the patronage of
the best people. The seven letters at the end of the inscription
have not yet been satisfactorily explained.</p>

<p>Advertisements of articles lost or found are also met with.
A notice in regard to a stray horse, painted on one of the tombs
east of the Amphitheatre, is given on <a href="#Page_436">p. 436</a>. On the east
side of Insula VIII. v.-vi. we read:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
VRNA AENIA PEREIT · DE · TABERNA<br />
SEIQVIS · RETTVLERIT DABVNTVR<br />
HS LXV · SEI · FVREM<br />
DABIT · VND ...</p>

<p>'A copper pot has been taken from this shop. Whoever brings
it back will receive 65 sesterces. If any one shall hand over the
thief' ... (the rest of the inscription is illegible).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER LVII<br />

<span class="s08"><i>THE GRAFFITI</i></span></h3>

<p>The graffiti form the largest division of the Pompeian inscriptions,
comprising about three thousand examples, or one half of
the entire number; the name is Italian, being derived from a
verb meaning 'to scratch.' Writing upon walls was a prevalent
habit in antiquity, as shown by the remains of graffiti at Rome
and other places besides Pompeii, a habit which may be accounted
for in part by the use of the sharp-pointed stylus with
wax tablets; the temptation to use such an instrument upon the
polished stucco was much greater than in the case of pens and
lead pencils upon the less carefully finished wall surfaces of our
time. Pillars or sections of wall are covered with scratches of
all kinds,&mdash;names, catchwords of favorite lines from the poets,
amatory couplets, and rough sketches, such as a ship, or the
profile of a face. The skit, occasionally found on walls to-day,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>'Fools' names, like their faces,</p>
<p>Are always seen in public places,'</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>has its counterpart in the couplet preserved as a graffito both
at Pompeii and at Rome: <i>Admiror, paries, te non cecidisse ruinis,
Qui tot scriptorum taedia sustineas</i>,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>'Truly 'tis wonderful, Wall, that you have not fallen in ruins,</p>
<p>Forced without murmur to bear the taint of so many hands.'</p>
</div></div>

<p>Of a similar vein is a Greek line scratched upon a wall on the
Palatine hill in Rome: 'Many persons have here written many
things; I alone refrained from writing.'</p>

<p>Taken as a whole, the graffiti are less fertile for our knowledge
of Pompeian life than might have been expected. The people
with whom we should most eagerly desire to come into direct contact,
the cultivated men and women of the ancient city, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span>
not accustomed to scratch their names upon stucco or to confide
their reflections and experiences to the surface of a wall. Some
of the graffiti, to judge from the height at which we find them
above the floor, were undoubtedly made by the hands of boys
and girls; for the rest, we may assume that the writers were as
little representative of the best elements of society as are the
tourists who scratch or carve their names upon ancient monuments
to-day. Nevertheless, we gain from these scribblings a
lively idea of individual tastes, passions, and experiences.</p>

<p>A few graffiti have reference to events, as the siege of Sulla,
in 89 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> (<a href="#Page_240">p. 240</a>). The most interesting historical examples
are those which relate to the conflict between the Pompeians
and the Nucerians, in the year 59 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> (<a href="#Page_220">p. 220</a>). An ardent
Pompeian wrote: <i>Nucerinis infelicia</i>,&mdash;'Down with the Nucerians!'
From a scribbling by a partisan of the other side it
appears that the inhabitants of Puteoli sympathized with the
Nucerians, while those of Pithecusae&mdash;the island of Ischia&mdash;favored
the Pompeians: <i>Puteolanis feliciter, omnibus Nucherinis
felicia, et uncu[m] Pompeianis [et] Pitecusanis</i>,&mdash;'Hurrah for
the Puteolaneans, good luck to all Nucerians; a hook for the
Pompeians and Pithecusans.' The hook referred to in this
connection was that used by executioners and the attendants of
the Amphitheatre in dragging off the dead. Another Pompeian
wrote: <i>Campani, victoria una cum Nucerinis peristis</i>,&mdash;'Campanians,
you were conquered by the same victory with the Nucerians.'
The Campani were not the inhabitants of Campania,
but of the suburb called Pagus Campanus.</p>

<p>Two inscriptions, attesting the presence of members of the
Praetorian Guard in Pompeii, have been previously mentioned
(<a href="#Page_387">pp. 387</a>, <a href="#Page_401">401</a>). Another praetorian left his name in a house of
the eighth Region (VIII. iii. 21): <i>Sex. Decimius Rufus milis
coh[ortis] V pr[aetorianae] Ↄ Martialis</i>,&mdash;'Sextus Decimius
Rufus, a soldier of the fifth praetorian cohort, of the century led
by Martialis.' To the same division of the army probably belonged
a centurion of the first rank, Q. Spurennius Priscus,
whose name was found in a house of the first Region (I. iii. 3).
The first, fifth, and ninth praetorian cohorts, mentioned in the
graffiti, may have come to Pompeii with different emperors, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span>
on different occasions with the same emperor; it is unlikely that
the three were united to form a single escort.</p>

<p>Graffiti are sometimes useful for the identification of buildings;
so in the case of the Basilica and of several inns. The
dated examples throw some light on the age of the stucco on
which they are found. They are for the most part late, and
afford little help in determining the time of commencement of the
various decorative styles; but in several cases they indicate a later
limit clearly. In this way we learn that the decoration of the
Basilica, in the first style, was finished before October 3, 78 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>&mdash;how
long before we cannot tell; and that in 37 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> the plastering
of the Small Theatre was already on the walls, decorated
in the second style. The gladiatorial graffito in the house of
the Centenary (<a href="#Page_226">p. 226</a>) proves that the decoration of the room in
which it is found&mdash;a late example of the second style&mdash;was
finished before November, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 15. A dated inscription of the
reign of Nero is given in the chapter on the house of the Silver
Wedding (<a href="#Page_305">p. 305</a>).</p>

<p>Several hundred graffiti present merely the name of the scribbler,
sometimes with the addition <i>hic fuit</i>,&mdash;'was here,' or simply
<i>hic</i>; as, <i>Paris hic fuit</i>, <i>Sabinus hic</i>.</p>

<p>A large number contain a greeting, perhaps in some cases
intended for the eye of the person mentioned, as <i>Aemilius Fortunato
fratri salutem</i>,&mdash;'Aemilius greets his brother Fortunatus.'
In this as in other examples it is interesting to note that one
brother is designated by the gens name, the other by the cognomen.
Sometimes the greeting is the reverse of cordial, as in this
instance: <i>Samius Cornelio, suspendere</i>,&mdash;'Samius to Cornelius:
go hang yourself.' Hardly less naïve is the message to a friend
who has died: <i>Pyrrhus Chio conlegae sal[utem]: moleste fero,
quod audivi te mortuom; itaq[ue] vale</i>,&mdash;'Pyrrhus to his
chum Chius: I'm sorry to hear that you are dead; and so,
Good-by.'</p>

<p>The most prominent theme of the graffiti is love, which is
constantly reappearing, in prose scribblings and in snatches of
verse. The verse form is usually the elegiac distich. Some
of the lines are taken from the poets; others were made up
for the occasion, and not a few verses were finished in prose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span>
as if the would-be versifier found original composition more difficult
than he had anticipated.</p>

<p>Several distichs extol the power of love, as the following,
which, taken from some unknown poet, is found in several
places: <i>Quisquis amat, valeat, pereat qui nescit amare; Bis tanto
pereat quisquis amare vetat</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>'Good health be with you, lovers all;</p>
<p class="i1">Who knows not how to love, be cursed;</p>
<p>But oh may double ruin fall</p>
<p class="i1">On him who sets out love to worst!'</p>
</div></div>
<p>A similar thought finds expression in a single line, perhaps also
a quotation: <i>Nemo est bellus nisi qui amavit mulierem</i>,&mdash;'He
who has never been in love can be no gentleman.'</p>

<p>Not all the Pompeians, however, viewed the matter so seriously.
To the first line of the couplet just quoted a scribbler of
a cynical turn in one instance joined a parody, to the effect that
those who are in love may well avoid the use of hot baths, on
the principle that 'the burnt child dreads the fire,'&mdash;<i>Nam
nemo flammas ustus amare potest.</i></p>

<p>The uselessness of interference with the course of love is also
made prominent. In this distich, apparently from some poet,
the scribbler seems to have made a slight change to meet a
specific case, substituting <i>obiurgat</i> for <i>custodit</i> or some similar
word: <i>Alliget hic auras, si quis obiurgat amantes, Et vetat
assiduas currere fontis aquas</i>,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>'Whoever has a mind</p>
<p class="i1">To hinder lovers' way,</p>
<p>Let him go zephyrs bind</p>
<p class="i1">Or running waters stay.'</p>
</div></div>

<p>Ancient lovers nevertheless had their fears, and the following
couplet, which is no doubt borrowed from a poet, appears
also, in a slightly different form, on a wall in Rome: <i>Si quis
forte meam cupiet violare puellam, Illum in desertis montibus
urat Amor</i>,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>'If any man shall seek</p>
<p class="i1">My girl from me to turn,</p>
<p>On far-off mountains bleak</p>
<p class="i1">May Love the scoundrel burn.'</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">495</a></span></p>

<p>Of extant elegiac poets Ovid, Propertius, and Tibullus are
quoted or paraphrased. Among the quotations is the familiar
couplet of Propertius: <i>Nunc est ira recens, nunc est discedere
tempus; Si dolor afuerit, crede, redibit amor</i>,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>'Now is it time to depart,</p>
<p class="i1">Now anger freshly burns;</p>
<p>When one ceases to feel the smart,</p>
<p class="i1">Believe me, love returns.'</p>
</div></div>

<p>If it was written by a lover after a quarrel, reconciliation was
not far off. Another discouraged suitor perhaps consoled himself
by writing on the wall of the Basilica this distich from
Ovid's "Art of Love," the form of which differs slightly from
that given in the manuscripts: <i>Quid pote tam durum saxso aut
quid mollius unda? Dura tamen molli saxsa cavantur aqua</i>,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>'What is so hard as rock, or what can be softer than water?</p>
<p class="i1">Hard rocks nevertheless by water are worn away.'</p>
</div></div>

<p>Amatory inscriptions often have the form of a message or
greeting to a loved one, as in this example: <i>Victoria, vale, et
ubique es, suaviter sternutes</i>,&mdash;'Health to you, Victoria, and
wherever you are may you sneeze sweetly,' that is, may good
luck follow you. Often the greeting is more ardent, as that to
Cestilia: <i>Cestilia, regina Pompeianorum, anima dulcis, vale</i>,&mdash;'Cestilia,
queen of the Pompeians, sweet soul, greeting to you.'</p>

<p>Sometimes the lover avoided writing the lady's name: <i>Pupa
quae bella es, tibi me misit qui tuus est; vale</i>,&mdash;'Maiden who
are so beautiful, he who is yours sent me to you; good-by.'
Now and then we find an inscription of this class that leaves an
unfavorable impression. The following is repeated several times
on the outside of a house in the first Region: <i>Serenae sodales
sal[utem]</i>,&mdash;'Greeting to Serena, from her companions!'</p>

<p>Spurned lovers also confided their woes to graffiti, sometimes
adding an appeal to the obdurate one, as in this wretched couplet,
which can scarcely have been taken from a poet; the play
upon words in the last clause was apparently intentional: <i>Si
quid amor valeat nostei, sei te hominem scis, Commiseresce mihi,
da veniam ut veniam</i>,&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">496</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>'If you a man would be,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">If you know what love can do,&mdash;</p>
<p>Have pity, and suffer me</p>
<p class="i1">With welcome to come to you.'</p>
</div></div>

<p>It was probably a lover in straits who scratched on the wall a
line of the Aeneid (IX. 404) as a prayer to Venus: <i>Tu, dea, tu
praesens nostro succurre labori</i>,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>'Thou, goddess, with thy present help</p>
<p class="i1">Our sore distress relieve.'</p>
</div></div>

<p>Another unsuccessful suitor found the lines of a single poet
inadequate to express his feelings, and joined together a couplet
from Ovid (Am. I. viii. 77-78) and one from Propertius (IV. v.
47-48) in order to voice his complaint against a miserly mistress
who barred her door upon all except wealthy lovers. But the
climax is reached in four lines of irregular verse in which the
rejected lover proposes to vent his anger on the goddess of
love herself: 'All lovers, come! I purpose to break the ribs of
Venus and to smash the small of her back with clubs; if she can
bore a hole in my tender breast, why can I not break her head
with a cudgel?' From the psychological point of view the
complete identification of the goddess with a statue representing
her is noteworthy.</p>

<p>Occasionally a pair of lovers left on a wall a record of a meeting;
thus, <i>Romula hic cum Staphylo moratur</i>,&mdash;'Romula tarried
here with Staphylus.' Staphylus, however, was apparently a
flirt; in the house of Caecilius Jucundus a similar meeting with
another maiden is recorded on a column of the peristyle: <i>Staphilus
hic cum Quieta</i>. But Staphylus does not seem to have gained
the confidence of the fair sex to the extent that another Pompeian
gallant did, of whom we find it written: <i>Restitutus multas decepit
saepe puellas</i>,&mdash;'Restitutus has many times deceived many
girls.'</p>

<p>The names of husband and wife are sometimes joined together,
as in a room of a house in the ninth Region: <i>L. Clodius Varus,
Pelagia coniunx</i>; there is a similar example in a house ruined
by the earthquake of the year 63, <i>[Ba]lbus et Fortunata, duo
coiuges</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span></p>

<p>We find a pleasing instance of marital affection in a graffito
in which a lonely wife sends a greeting to an absent husband
and other relatives: <i>Hirtia Psacas C. Hostilio Conopi coniugi
suo manuductori et clementi monitori et Diodot[a]e sorori et Fortunato
fratri et Celeri suis salutem semper ubique plurimam, et
Primigeniae suae salutem</i>,&mdash;'Hirtia Psacas at all times and in
all places sends heartiest greeting to Gaius Hostilius Conops, her
husband and guide and gentle adviser, and to her sister Diodota,
her brother Fortunatus and her Celer; and she sends a greeting
to her Primigenia, too.' The names of both husband and wife
are Greek, <i>psacas</i> signifying 'dewdrop,' and <i>conops</i> 'gnat.'</p>

<p>Many happenings are chronicled on the walls; and there are
memoranda of every description. The programmes of gladiatorial
combats have already been mentioned (<a href="#Page_223">p. 223</a>). One man
records the result of a trip to Nuceria, where he won at the
gaming table&mdash;without cheating, he takes pains to add&mdash;a
sum amounting to $130: <i>Vici Nuceriae in alia</i> (for <i>alea</i>)
&#65942; <i>DCCCLVS, fide bona</i>,&mdash;'At Nuceria, I won 855.5 denarii
by gaming, fair play.'</p>

<p>Another Pompeian counted the steps as he walked up and
down the colonnade at the side of his garden (in the house VII.
ii. 41) for exercise; he recorded 640 paces for ten turns back
and forth.</p>

<p>In the peristyle of a house in the first Region the advent of
young pigs, or of puppies, is noted: <i>XV K[alendas] Nov[embres]
Puteolana peperit mascl[os] III, femel[as] II</i>,&mdash;'On
October 17 Puteolana had a litter consisting of 3 males and 2
females.'</p>

<p>The inscriptions relating to business transactions are reserved
for another chapter. We may notice here, however, that
memoranda of accounts were sometimes scratched on walls,
usually containing only the figures indicating measure or price,
as in the shops on the south side of the Macellum. The following
is from a bakery in the first Region (I. iii. 27): <i>Oleum,
l[ibra], a[ssibus] IV; palea a. V; faenum a. XVI; diaria a.
V; furfure a. VI; viria I a. III; oleum a. VI</i>,&mdash;'Oil, a pound,
4 asses; straw, 5 asses; hay, 16 asses; a day's wages, 5 asses;
bran, 6 asses; one wreath for the neck, 3 asses; oil, 6 asses.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a></span>
The value of the as varied; in the Early Empire it was nearly
equivalent to 1½ pence, or 3 cents.</p>

<p>Children scratched upon walls the alphabet that they were
learning. The frequent quotations from Virgil, generally incomplete,
are likewise an echo of lessons at school, where this
author was carefully studied; we find very often the beginnings
of lines at the opening of a book, as <i>Arma virumque cano</i>, or
<i>Conticuere omnes</i>. The first word of the poem of Lucretius,
<i>Aeneadum</i>, also occurs several times.</p>

<p>Occasionally gnomic quotations are found, in most cases,
perhaps, from writers of comedy. Among them is the well-known
maxim, <i>Minimum malum fit contemnendo maxumum</i>,&mdash;'The
smallest evil, if neglected, will reach the greatest proportions.'
A proverb more concrete in its form of statement is the
following: <i>Moram si quaeres, sparge milium et collige</i>,&mdash;'If you
want to waste your time, scatter millet and pick it up again.'

<h3>CHAPTER LVIII<br />

<span class="s08"><i>INSCRIPTIONS RELATING TO BUSINESS AFFAIRS</i></span></h3>

<p>The most important inscriptions relating to business transactions
are the receipts, discovered in 1875, which formed a part
of the private accounts of L. Caecilius Jucundus (<a href="#Page_447">p. 447</a>). They
were written on wax tablets, which were carefully packed in a
wooden box. The box, which was in the second story of the
house, crumbled to pieces when the volcanic dust about it was
removed; but many of the tablets, 154 in number, still retained
their shape and were taken to the Naples Museum. The wood
of the tablets had turned to charcoal, but the writing has been
for the most part deciphered. One receipt dates from 15 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>,
another from the year 27; the rest belong to the decade immediately
preceding the earthquake, 52-62 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> The documents
are of the greatest interest as casting light on the business
methods of antiquity.</p>

<p>Most of the tablets are triptychs. The three leaves were tied
at the back so as to open like the leaves of a book, making six
pages (<a href="#fig274">Fig. 274</a>). The average height is about 5 inches, the
width varies from 2 to 4 inches. Pages 1 and 6 served as
covers, being left smooth and without writing. Pages 2, 3, and
5 were hollowed out, leaving a polished surface with a raised
rim around it. On this surface a thin layer of wax was spread,
in which the letters were made with a stylus; the writing could
be easily read because the wood, which was of a light color,
showed through wherever a scratch was made in the wax
coating.</p>

<p>Two pages facing each other, 2 and 3, were devoted to the
receipt. Page 4, as shown in <a href="#fig275">Fig. 275</a>, was not hollowed out
but was divided into two parts by a broad, flat groove running
across the middle. When the document was ready to be sealed,
the first two leaves were brought together and tied by a thread
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span>
which passed around the middle, the ends meeting in the groove
on page 4. In this groove at convenient distances melted wax
was then dropped, on which the witnesses, ordinarily seven in
number, impressed their seals. The names of the witnesses
were written with pen and ink in a line with the seals, parallel
with the sides of the page, sometimes at the right, as in <a href="#fig275">Fig. 275</a>,
sometimes divided, the first name and the gens name being at
the left of the seal, the cognomen at the right.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="fig274" id="fig274"></a>
<img src="images/fig274.jpg" width="544" height="431" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 274.&mdash;Tablet with three leaves, opened so as to show the receipt and part of the
memorandum on page 5, restored.</p>
</div>

<p>This arrangement made it impossible to consult the receipt
without cutting the thread or disturbing the seals of the witnesses.
To meet the difficulty a memorandum, which was practically
a duplicate receipt, was placed on page 5; this could be
read at any time.</p>

<p>The difference in form between the receipt, on pages 2 and 3,
and the memorandum will be plain from the examples. The
receipt, with few exceptions, is simply a record of an oral acknowledgment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a></span>
in the presence of witnesses that a sum of money
was received, <i>accepti latio</i>. In nearly all the tablets this acknowledgment
and the names of the witnesses, on page 4, are
in the same handwriting, which must have been either that of
Jucundus himself or of his secretary. It did not matter who
wrote the receipt; in case of a dispute the seals of the witnesses
would alone be sufficient to prove its genuineness. The
memorandum, however, was ordinarily in a different hand,
either that of the person who gave the receipt, or of some one
authorized to write for him. As it was not under the seals of
witnesses, the handwriting might become a matter of importance
if any question should arise in regard to the document.</p>

<img src="images/fig275.jpg" width="531" height="390" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 275.&mdash;Tablet, restored, with the two leaves containing the receipt tied and sealed, and
with the signatures of the witnesses at the right of the seals.</p>
</div>

<p>The entire tablet, with its receipt, memorandum, and names
and seals of witnesses was called <i>perscriptio</i>, 'entry of account.'
This word appears ordinarily on the edge of the tablet, with the
name of the person who gave the receipt in the genitive case.</p>

<p>Nearly all the tablets record transactions connected with auction
sales, the person whose effects were thus disposed of giving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">502</a></span>
Jucundus a receipt in full for the proceeds of the sale less a commission,
<i>mercede minus</i>. A few contain receipts for rent which
Jucundus paid for the use of property belonging to the city&mdash;a
fullery (<a href="#Page_394">p. 394</a>), the rent of which altogether amounted to 1652
sesterces, about $75; a pasture, for the use of which he paid 2675
sesterces, about $130; and a piece of arable land, <i>fundus</i>, on
which he paid 6000 sesterces, about $300, in rents.</p>

<p>We present an example of both classes of receipts. The
first, which we may call Tablet A, was given by a lady, Umbricia
Januaria, for the proceeds of an auction sale; it is dated
December 12, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 56. The other, Tablet B, is the receipt for
the rent of public pasture land and belongs to the year 59 <span class="s08">A.D.</span></p>

<p>Tablet A gives the ordinary form of the receipt and the memorandum.
There are occasional variations. A few tablets have
only two leaves and four pages. In such cases, the leaves are
tied and sealed in the same way as the first two of the triptych,
but only half of the fourth page is left for the signatures of the
witnesses; the memorandum is written on the other half with
pen and ink, and so appears on the outside of the tablet.</p>

<p>In two of the older tablets, dated 27 and 54 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>, the memorandum,
as the receipt, is a record of an oral acknowledgment;
it may be that this was the proper legal form in use to the end
of the reign of Claudius. In a few of the later examples, as
Tablet B, the receipt as well as the memorandum has the form
of a voucher in the handwriting of the person who receives the
money, or his agent.

<p>The language of the memorandum is so nearly identical with
that of the receipt that it is unnecessary to add a translation.</p>

<p class="p2">A considerable number of the amphorae found at Pompeii
bear inscriptions, generally written with a pen in black ink,
but sometimes painted with a brush in red or white. Most
of them contained wine. The percentage of Greek inscriptions
is large, an evidence of the strength of the Greek population in
the region about the city.</p>

<p>The wine underwent fermentation in large round vats of
baked clay, <i>dolia</i>, which stood in the wine cellar of the villa,
<i>cella vinaria</i>, or in a court (<a href="#Page_364">p. 364</a>); from these the amphorae
were filled. The vats containing the common wines were ordinarily
emptied before the next vintage, when they were needed
for the new wine, but the better sorts were allowed to remain in
the dolia for a longer time. The wine of one Pompeian amphora
was left in the vat till after the harvest of the second year:
<i>C. Pomponio C. Anicio cos., ex fund[o] Badiano, diff[usum] id.
Aug., bimum</i>,&mdash;'Consulship of Gaius Pomponius and Gaius
Anicius. From the Badian estate. Poured (into amphorae)
August 13. Two years old.' In what year Pomponius and
Anicius were consuls we do not know.</p>

<p>The earliest amphora of which the date is certain was filled
in 25 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>: [<i>Cosso Len]tulo M. Asinio cos. fund.</i> The place from
which it came, however, is not so easily determined, since <i>fund.</i>
may refer to the town of Fundi, or stand for <i>fundus</i>, 'estate,'
the name that followed having been obliterated. The names
of two such estates were lately recovered from amphorae in the
house of the Vettii, <i>fundus Satrianus</i> and <i>fundus Asinianus</i>.</p>

<p>In addition to the product of Italian vineyards the Pompeians
used also imported wines from the coast of Asia Minor and the
islands near by. One dealer, M. Fabius Euporus, kept wine
from Cnidus, <i>Cnidium</i>. Wine from the island of Cos is frequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span>
mentioned, as in this inscription: <i>Coum vet[us] P. Appulei
Bassi</i>,&mdash;'Old Coan of Publius Appuleius Bassus.'</p>

<p>Different kinds of wine were sometimes designated by characteristic
names. A certain Greek, M. Pomponius Teupon,
produced a brand which he called 'Frenzy Wine' (<span class="greek" title="Lyttios">Λύττιος</span>),
as if so strong that it would make the drinker frantic. Another
Greek, Timarchus, named one of his wines 'White Drink,'
<span class="greek" title="Leukounarion">Λευκουνάριον</span>.</p>

<p>An amphora in the house of the Vettii was labelled <i>Gustaticium</i>,
'Breakfast Drink'; it no doubt contained <i>mulsum</i>, a
kind of mead made by mixing honey with wine, which the
ancients drank with the first meal of the day. The word
<i>mulsum</i> occurs on another amphora discovered previously.</p>

<p>Fruits and other edibles of all kinds were kept in amphorae.
On one was written: <i>Oliva alba dulce</i> (for <i>olivae albae dulces</i>)
<i>P. C. E.</i>,&mdash;'White sweet olives of P. C. E.'; the name cannot
be determined from the initials. On other amphorae the words
for bean meal (<i>lomentum</i>), honey, and lentils appear, the last
being designated by the Greek word.</p>

<p>A large number of small jars contained the fish sauces,&mdash;<i>garum</i>,
<i>liquamen</i>, and <i>muria</i>,&mdash;of which the ancients were so
fond; reference has already been made to Umbricius Scaurus
(<a href="#Page_15">p. 15</a>), who seems to have had several establishments for the
making of the sauces, conducted by slaves, freedmen, and perhaps
by members of his family.</p>

<p>The best quality of <i>garum</i>, which was probably a thick
preparation, a kind of fish jelly, was designated by the letters
<i>g. f.</i>, for <i>garum&mdash;flos</i>, 'garum blossom,' as in the following
inscription: <i>g[arum]&mdash;f[los] scombr[i] Scauri ab Eutyche
Scauri</i>,&mdash;'Scaurus's tunny jelly, blossom brand, put up by
Eutyches, slave of Scaurus.' We frequently find <i>liquamen optimum</i>,
'best liquamen.'</p>

<p>The <i>muria</i> was apparently a fish pickle, certain parts of the
fish, or certain varieties, being preserved in brine. According
to Pliny the Elder some fish sauces were prepared in a special
way, to be used by the Jews on fast days; two of these, as
already noted, appear in the inscriptions upon Pompeian jars,
<i>garum castum</i> and <i>muria casta</i> (<a href="#Page_18">p. 18</a>).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a></span></p>

<p>In these inscriptions upon jars of various sizes the name of
the proprietor is sometimes given, in the genitive case, as <i>M.
Caesi Celeris</i>,&mdash;'Of M. Caesius Celer.' The name of the man
to whom the consignment is made is put in the dative, as <i>Albucio
Celso</i>.</p>

<p>The name of the consignor sometimes follows that of the
consignee, as <i>liquamen optimum A. Virnio Modesto ab Agathopode</i>,&mdash;'Best
liquamen, for Aulus Virnius Modestus, from
Agathopus.'</p>

<p>An inscription similar to that just mentioned, on an amphora
found in the house of Caecilius Jucundus, illustrates the extent
to which family pride might assert itself in the naming of children:
<i>Caecilio Iucundo ab Sexsto Metello</i>,&mdash;'To Caecilius Jucundus
from Sextus Metellus.' The sender and the recipient were
both sons of Lucius Caecilius Jucundus. According to common
usage, one of the sons would have received the name Lucius
Caecilius Jucundus, after the father; while the other would have
been called Lucius Caecilius, with a cognomen derived perhaps
from the name of the mother. But the prosperous Pompeian
wished to suggest a relationship with the distinguished family
of the Caecilii Metelli, so he named one son Sextus Caecilius
Jucundus Metellus, and the other Quintus Caecilius Jucundus,
the name Quintus being common in the family of the Caecilii
Metelli. The names of the two sons are found together in an
election notice: <i>Q. S. Caecili Iucundi</i>,&mdash;'Quintus and Sextus
Caecilius Jucundus.'</p>

<p>Besides the names of the makers, inscriptions relating to
weight and ownership are found on the cups and other objects
of the Boscoreale treasure. Thus on the under side of the
Alexandria patera (<a href="#fig187">Fig. 187</a>, and <a href="#Page_380">p. 380</a>) we find the following
record, the letters of which are outlined with points: <i>Phi[ala]
et emb[lema] p[endentia] p[ondo libras] II, uncias X, scrupula
VI. Phi[ala] p[endens] p[ondo libras] II, uncias II,
semunciam; emb[lema] p[endens] p[ondo] uncias VII, semunciam</i>,
'The bowl and the relief medallion' together 'weigh
2 pounds, 10 ounces, and 6 scruples. The bowl weighs 2
pounds, 2½ ounces; the relief medallion weighs 7½ ounces.'
In giving the items separately no account was taken of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a></span>
scruples. Reckoning the Roman pound as 327.453 grammes,
the weight of the patera with its relief was 934.608 grammes, or
2.504 Troy pounds. This differs from the present weight by
less than a gramme.</p>

<p>Occasionally a name in the genitive case is found with the
record of weight, written with the same kind of letters; in such
cases it is probably safe to assume that the name is that of the
original owner. On the under side of one of the pair of cups
ornamented with skeletons (<a href="#fig217">Fig. 217</a>) is the inscription:
GAVIAE P·II·S&#65936;IIII;
a later hand, writing with a fine point, added
VAS II
in the space after GAVIAE, as if to supply an obvious
omission, so that the inscription in full would read, <i>Gaviae.
Vas[a] II [pendentia] p[ondo libras] II, uncias VIII, [scrupula]
IV</i>, 'The property of Gavia. The two cups weigh 2
pounds, 8 ounces, and 4 scruples' (2.351 Troy pounds).</p>

<p>In some instances the name of a later owner has been scratched
on the surface with a pointed tool. The name of a woman,
Maxima, written in full or in abbreviation, appears on forty-five
of the pieces in the Louvre. We may safely accept the conclusion
of De Villefosse, that she is probably the one who made
the collection, obtaining her specimens from different sources,
and that to her the Boscoreale treasure belonged at the time of
the eruption.</p>

<p>Besides the seals which were used in signing documents the
Romans had stamps, <i>signacula</i>, which they impressed upon
various articles as a means of identification or as an advertisement.
Impressions of such stamps are found upon bricks and
other objects of clay, and in one or two instances upon loaves
of bread. Several charred loaves in the Naples Museum have
the stamp: <i>[C]eleris Q. Grani Veri ser.</i>,&mdash;'(Made by) Celer,
slave of Quintus Granius Verus.'</p>

<p>The names upon stamps appear regularly in the genitive case,
as <i>N. Popidi Prisci</i>, spelled backward on the stamp, so that the
letters appear in the right order in the impression. Since the
time of Fiorelli many houses have been named from the stamps
found in them; in the house of the Vettii, for example, two
stamps were found with the names of Aulus Vettius Restitutus
and Aulus Vettius Conviva.

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

<h3 class="chap1"><a name="chap_lix" id="chap_lix">CHAPTER LIX</a><br />

<span class="s08"><i>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE POMPEIAN CULTURE</i></span></h3>

<p>The ideals of a nation&mdash;the true index of its culture&mdash;find
expression alike in its laws, its literature, its art, and the environment
of daily life. They are a common heritage, which one
generation passes on to another with its own increment of change,
and their influence extends as far as that of the people whose
spirit is manifested in them. Thus it happens that the conditions
of culture found in a single city, unless that city, as
Athens, had an independent development as a state, are not
isolated but are determined in the main by general movements
and tendencies, and are reproduced, with local differences, in all
places having the same racial and political connections. The
local element was more pronounced and more characteristic in
ancient than in modern cities; yet, unless the surroundings were
exceptionably favorable, we should not be warranted in expecting
to find in a small city an isolated development of special significance
in art or taste. Pompeii forms no exception to the
rule.</p>

<p>The situation of Pompeii was unfavorable to the growth of an
indigenous culture. Founded by Samnites, a primitive folk, it
lay in the overlapping edges of two great zones of influence,
Greek and Roman. It was a small town, which never rose to
the dignity even of a provincial capital. It was a seaport, which
through marine traffic kept in touch with other cities, especially
those of the East, from which fashions of art, religion, and life
travelled easily westward. The political institutions of the Pompeians
were at first those which they shared in common with
the Samnite and Oscan cities of the mountains and the Campanian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">510</a></span>
plain, later those imposed upon them by the forceful and
levelling administration of Rome. The literature which they
read, as we learn from quotations scratched upon the walls,
consisted of the Greek and Roman writers of their own or previous
periods; not a single line of an Oscan drama or poem
has been found. Their art was a reproduction of designs and
masterpieces produced elsewhere,&mdash;at first under Hellenistic,
later under Roman influence,&mdash;on a scale commensurate with
the limited resources of the place. Finally the countless appliances
of everyday life, from the fixed furniture of the atrium to
articles of toilet, were not rare and costly objects such as were
seen in the wealthy homes of Rome or Alexandria, but those of
the commoner sort everywhere in use. Any one of fifty cities
might have been overwhelmed in the place of Pompeii, and the
results, so far as our knowledge of the ancient culture in its
larger aspects is concerned, would not have been essentially
different.</p>

<p>The representative rather than exceptional character of the
remains at Pompeii makes them either of less or of greater value,
according as we look at them from different points of view. If
we are seeking for the most perfect examples of ancient art, for
masterpieces of the famous artists, we do not find them. Many
of the Pompeian paintings appeal to modern taste; yet it would
be as unfair to judge of the merits of ancient painting from the
specimens which are worked into the decorative designs of
Pompeian walls as it would be to base an estimate of the value
of modern art upon chromos and wall papers. For the noblest
creations of ancient art in any field we must look not to provincial
towns, but to the great centres of population and of political
administration, where genius found encouragement, inspiration,
and adequate means. No large city, fortunately for its inhabitants,
was visited by such a disaster as that which befell the
Campanian town; and the wealth of artistic types at Pompeii
bears witness to the universality of art in the Greco-Roman
world.</p>

<p>Since these remains are so broadly typical, they are invaluable
for the interpretation of the civilization of which they formed a
part. They shed light on countless passages of Greek and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">511</a></span>
Roman writers. Literature, however, ordinarily records only
that which is exceptional or striking, while here we find the
surroundings of life as a whole, the humblest details being
presented to the eye.</p>

<p>Pompeii, as no other source outside the pages of classical
authors, helps us to understand the ancient man.

<p><i>The tribunals</i> [<a href="#Page_145">p. 145</a>]: it is evident from the language of Suetonius (Div.
Aug. 44, solis virginibus Vestalibus locum in theatro separatim et contra praetoris
tribunal dedit) that opposite the place set aside for the praetor, which
was called tribunal, there was another likewise reserved. In our theatre the
two platforms mentioned correspond exactly with this arrangement, and there
is no other part of the structure to which the word <i>tribunalia</i>, in the inscription
of the Holconii (<a href="#Page_148">p. 148</a>), could properly be applied. We are safe therefore
in calling the platforms tribunals.</p>

that on account of the baiting of a bear by one of the figures with a cloth the
tomb could not have been built before the time of Claudius. The passage
cited by him (Plin. N. H. VIII. <span class="s08">XVI.</span> 54) has no bearing on the date; but
the tomb of Scaurus, which belongs neither to the oldest nor to the most
recent, may well have been built in the time of Claudius or of Nero.</p>

(Pompéi, 1830, p. 37) to the effect that it was found in the niche where it now

unfortunately lost.</p>

assuming his praenomen and nomen, so that the full name took the form given
in the inscription. The son dropped the original nomen Luccius, and was
called simply M. Alleius Libella. In like manner the name of the son of
D. Lucretius Satrius Valens became D. Lucretius Valens [<a href="#Page_222">p. 222</a>].</p>

<p><i>Of the sculptures found at Pompeii</i>: Very few of the sculptures unearthed
at Pompeii are treated or reproduced in the comprehensive works on ancient
sculpture. The more important statues and reliefs found prior to 1865, as well
as those discovered in Herculaneum, are published in the Real Museo Borbonico,
with descriptive text; see the Index at the end of vol. 16, pp. 8-34.
They are reproduced also by <span class="smcap">Roux</span>, with descriptive text by Barré, Herculanum
et Pompéi, vols. 6 and 7 (first part). These engravings, while in many
cases faulty, are often serviceable to students at a distance in the identification
of photographs, which are easily obtained through the Naples dealers. The
better terra-cottas are published by <span class="smcap">Von Rohden</span>, Die Terracotten von Pompeji
(Stuttgart, 1880). A somewhat fuller treatment of Pompeian sculpture is
given in <span class="smcap">Overbeck-Mau</span>, Pompeji, pp. 532-563.</p>

before 1880, by <span class="smcap"> Sogliano</span>, Le pitture murali Campane scoverte negli anni
1867-1879 (supplemento all' opera dell' Helbig, Naples, 1879. Published also
in the volume, Pompei e la regione sotterrata dal Vesuvio, for which see
p. 513); those that have come to light since 1879 are described by <span class="smcap">Mau</span> in
his reports (see <a href="#chap4_note">note to Chap. IV</a>) and in the Notizie degli scavi; cf. also

<p>The names of only the more important streets are given on Plan VI.
Among the names omitted are those of the continuations of Nola Street,
which it is more convenient to regard as a single thoroughfare extending
without change of name across the city.</p>

<p>The more important buildings of each Region are given in the order of
the Insulae.</p>

pleased me more than Mr. Crawford's 'Roma.' It is cast in a form so original and so

<p><span class="smcap">F. Marion Crawford</span> says of this work: "Professor Mau has succeeded beyond all
those who have preceded him on the same ground. He reconstructs the ruins so that
one believes in them, and sees that they must have been as he describes them, and the
excellent drawings of these reconstructions stimulate the reader's belief. He restores the
decorations next, and furnishes the vacant dwellings in a way that seems natural, and
even comfortable; and, lastly, he populates the city he has so skilfully rebuilt, not with
the dull lay figures in togas or tunics so dear to scientific history, but with human beings,
alive and moving."</p>

<p>This handsomely illustrated book is a companion volume in its make-up to Mau's
"Pompeii." Its object is to give an adequate and at the same time popular account of
Ancient Athens, from the earliest times down to the official introduction of Christianity.
The book deals mainly with the topography of the city and Acropolis, the extant remains
of ancient buildings, and the sculpture that decorated them. It includes the results of
recent excavation and research; but controversial matters have, as far as possible, been
relegated to notes and appendices. A full description is given of the Parthenon, the
Erechtheum, Theatre, and other buildings, and such questions as the water supply, the
walls of town and harbours, the position of the Agora, and the route Pausanias, are duly
considered. The general aim of the author is to stimulate and assist the historical imagination
by bringing Ancient Athens, in various periods of its growth, vividly before the
eyes of the ordinary well-informed reader, and to provide both those who have visited
Greece and those who have not with views and plans and illustrations to enable them to
realize the present appearance of the town and its monuments. For this purpose the
book is very fully illustrated, as far as possible, by means of photography. Above all,
the author has avoided, as far as possible, compilation or quotation from various writers,
and has endeavored to give a direct record of the impressions derived from a familiarity
with the sites and buildings described.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> It seems strange that traces of other buildings of the same period have not been
discovered; but, on the other hand, it is far from probable that the temple was first
erected, and that the city afterward grew up around it, for in that case the temple
must have been placed further west, on the highest point of the elevation, overlooking
the sea.</p>
